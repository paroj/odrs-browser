Clicking on 'Start' didn't seem to do anything, the encoding status does not update. I noticed however that the DVD was reading, then after searching in a file explorer, the size of the output file was increasing. \nSo I started again, and this time the process finished almost immediately, without producing anything. Somewhere in the log was a message about failing to overwrite an existing file. With a new output file, things started again, with huge amounts of unhelpful error log messages. Examining the output file during writing showed a strange aspect ratio with unsynchronised audio.\nHowever, I let it finish, and lo and behold, the utility had closed the file, corrected the aspect ratio, synchronised the audio, and even truncated off blank tape noise at the end of the recording.\nIf the author could find the time to bolt on an interface, this would be a winner.", "distro": "KDE neon", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 48581, "score": 0, "summary": "Good algorithm, poor interface", "user_display": "Ralph", "version": "0.14-0.2ubuntu8"}, {"app_id": "acidrip.desktop", "date_created": 1562780083.0, "description": "sudo apt install libdvd-pkg && sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 58107, "score": 0, "summary": "Works Great once you install the needed codec", "user_display": "tom", "version": "0.14"}, {"app_id": "acidrip.desktop", "date_created": 1580888181.0, "description": "I tried using it but it only ripped 45 mins of the file", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_PH", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 147001, "score": 0, "summary": "Does not do all the work", "user_display": "sam", "version": "0.14"}, {"app_id": "acidrip.desktop", "date_created": 1586422538.0, "description": "Flexible and easy to use, needs extra codecs to read the DVD.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 179415, "score": 0, "summary": "A Good GUI", "user_display": "ssd", "version": "0.14"}, {"app_id": "acidrip.desktop", "date_created": 1590366247.0, "description": "I'm not sure if it's my distro or just my computer, but whatever it is, it doesn't work for me.
