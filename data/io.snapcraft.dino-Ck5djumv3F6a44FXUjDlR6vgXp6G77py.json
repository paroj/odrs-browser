It is easy to navigate through and some useful filters. Swipe Left and Right, or just navigate through search and filter.\n\nSome suggestions would be: having maps to help visualise the where the species was found, include other info like pictures of fossils, where in the world you can find displays (if they exist) and links to resources like video clips where people have already tried to model and animate the species. Pretty sure that there's clips on BBC from their Walking with Dinosaurs stuff and Andy's Dinosaurs, a lot of this stuff might have ended up as short clips on their website.\n\nWould be brilliant if there was a way to bookmark species to create a personal inventory of favourites, maybe also include a line-art version of each picture so that children can print out and colour them in.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 223803, "score": 0, "summary": "Works fine on 20.04LTS", "user_display": "Adam", "version": "0.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.dino-Ck5djumv3F6a44FXUjDlR6vgXp6G77py", "date_created": 1604677369.0, "description": "Totally broken.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 299213, "score": 0, "summary": "Doesn't go past the intro screen", "user_display": "Connor", "version": "0.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.dino-Ck5djumv3F6a44FXUjDlR6vgXp6G77py", "date_created": 1622864167.0, "description": "i love this app\nthis is a type of encyclopedia", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_IN", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 385511, "score": 0, "summary": "op in the chat", "user_display": "Nazia", "version": "0.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.dino-Ck5djumv3F6a44FXUjDlR6vgXp6G77py", "date_created": 1632145695.0, "description": "I love in it wow type app", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_IN", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 421782, "score": 0, "summary": "very nice", "user_display": "harin", "version": "0.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.dino-Ck5djumv3F6a44FXUjDlR6vgXp6G77py", "date_created": 1638841155.0, "description": "required more work", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_IN", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 444718, "score": 0, "summary": "Not working , Its stuck on welcome page after installation", "user_display": "sachin", "version": "0.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.dino-Ck5djumv3F6a44FXUjDlR6vgXp6G77py", "date_created": 1650816256.0, "description": "moooola te explica como solian ser los dinosaurios en especimenes i en que manadas estavan", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "es_ES.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 481008, "score": 0, "summary": "moooooola", "user_display": "ERIK", "version": "0.1"}]
