It's well structured, has quite good export, the websites and pages produced are generated, but not overly detailed and have great Lighthouse marks. It offers social network integration. The WYSIWYG editor is simple to use and totally ready for non-technical people. \n\nIt has integrated some of the some popular ways of deploying static sites (S3, Netlify, Git[Hub|Lab] Pages, Git, (s)ftp, plain zip export and more. \n\nThe only thing it's lacking is good versioning support. Regardless, I would recommend this over Wordpress or similar CMS.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 234625, "score": 0, "summary": "Really capable tool for building sites for non-tech people", "user_display": "Zlatko \u0110uri\u0107", "version": "0.36.1"}, {"app_id": "Publii.desktop", "date_created": 1595675490.0, "description": "one of the best ssgs", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 251342, "score": 0, "summary": "Great tool", "user_display": "MehT", "version": "0.36.1"}, {"app_id": "Publii.desktop", "date_created": 1612205798.0, "description": "Very easy to use and works well.
