A zoom-in and zoom-out feature would help to solve this, or for some way to click on a column/row such that its hints are displayed in larger text.\n- Once a puzzle is completed, the victory text box completely obscures the puzzle itself, making it impossible to see the completed work. Either let us drag this window around, or present a \"view current puzzle\" button to hide the menu.\n- The app crashed my entire computer after I scrolled quickly through the puzzles starting at Round 40.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 597243, "score": 0, "summary": "It could use some improvement", "user_display": "schild", "version": "0.7.3"}, {"app_id": "com.adilhanney.super_nonogram", "date_created": 1692670180.0, "description": "The only missing feature I would want is arrow key support for playing on my laptop and a '?' marker for tiles that I'm not sure about yet.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 599571, "score": 0, "summary": "A satisfying nonogram game", "user_display": "Scott Lembcke", "version": "0.7.5"}, {"app_id": "com.adilhanney.super_nonogram", "date_created": 1695429813.0, "description": "It's an awesome game, but it needs better controls.
