I appreciate the time and effort the author may have put into it, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s well intentioned. The user interface is extremely confusing and difficult use.

I want to just enter a book, pick my chapter, and just read to the end... this program does not easily allow you to pick up from anywhere. Searches are not flexible enough to work well.
