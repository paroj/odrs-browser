But you should probably pass on this one. It doesn't receive regular security updates and you are potentially putting your personal information at risk by trusting it here. This is not necessarily their fault, they have a small dev team, but nevertheless, this is a potentially dangerous browser pick and you should not use it even if you support the company in other ways.\n\nThis browser is a fork of Brave, which is itself a fork of Chromium. The key features of Brave are easily togglable privacy features, and a currency distribution mechanism that rewards you and the websites you visit via BAT crypto grants.\n\nThe privacy toggles here are identical to Brave's... with one problem... if you actually take advantage of the more important features, Gab's software will not work. Turning off scripts will break the Dissenter extension, disallowing tracking and cookies will break certain Gab features, and Gab Social blocks Tor entirely, if you prefer to browse anonymously. Brave is a good browser to base a fork off, just not necessarily for their goals. They would have done better to fork Firefox, which already has inbuilt security measures and consumes less resources than a Chromium base with more features\n\nThe Dissenter browser also scraps the reward system, and replaces it with their URL comment extension, which is a really cool idea, but its lack of adoption makes it little more than a novelty, and the core of the product has shifted to a news offshoot that integrates all the same features, you can just as easily use that on any browser (or if you can find it, download the browser extension and install it on your browser of choice. Though Gab has taken down their download link so you'll have to try to find it from a 3rd Party)\n\nMaybe in the future, this will be the browser to go to. I trust this company not to datamine from their browser more than any other mainstream browsers, frankly. But until the team can assure regular security patches and fix compatibility with their own products, You're better off just using Brave or Firefox.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 132231, "score": 0, "summary": "Use Brave Instead", "user_display": null, "version": "0.70.122"}, {"app_id": "dissenter-browser.desktop", "date_created": 1610723021.0, "description": "The title says it all.
