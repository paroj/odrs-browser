It constantly downloads and instantly fails GPU-based tasks.\nThe app doesn't appear to always enforce CPU usage values or \"suspend\" commands, though that could just be an issue with the current task I have running.\nTasks stay suspended forever if I set the app to suspend based on mouse movement.\nThe app doesn't appear as a System Tray icon while running in the background.\nSometimes when I must relaunch BOINC multiple times because all the buttons are grayed out and no tasks are listed.\nBut at the end of the day, I can wrangle BOINC Manager into a working state, so I'm not too upset.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 1, "karma_up": 7, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 453362, "score": 22, "summary": "Not as flawless as the Windows 10 version", "user_display": "Wolf Icefang", "version": "stable"}, {"app_id": "edu.berkeley.BOINC", "date_created": 1704384497.0, "description": "He sido usuario del programa por SETI@home.
