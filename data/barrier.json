[{"app_id": "barrier", "date_created": 1597322416.0, "description": "I have barrier running on two laptops. Both of them are Fedora 32 and initially I had challenges making it work. I would start on both system, one will be the server and the other the client. Although I would see the mouse move out of the server and should have appeared in the client, it did not. It was after some poking around that I realized that one system was running X and the other Wayland. I switched both to X and it worked like a charm. \n\nOn my server laptop, i have an external monitor attached but on the client, there isn't. In order for the mouse to move from the server to the client, the mouse must first be on the external monitor and then to the client. The mose does not go directly from the server's laptop screen to the clients' laptop screen. I don't have a 2nd external monitor to test, but that would be something I would do soon.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 1, "karma_up": 11, "locale": "en_SG.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 258576, "score": 24, "summary": "works well enough", "user_display": "harish pillay", "version": "2.3.2"}, {"app_id": "barrier", "date_created": 1620315786.0, "description": "I really love this software.\n\nI have found it to NOT work properly with fedora 34.
