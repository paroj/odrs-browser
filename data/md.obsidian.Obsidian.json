So, I started looking for locally-installed alternatives.\n\nI found out about Obsidian because Chris Titus Tech mentioned it in a video comparing Arch, Debian, and Fedora. So I gave it a try. I found it difficult to do some of the things that I usually do extremely easily on GitLab. For example, copying the \"path\" to a header (for appending to URLs). On GitLab, you can just go into preview mode, click the link button next to the header, and copy it from the (now updated) URL in the address bar. I could not even find how to do this in Obsidian. It might be buried in menus somewhere. Not sure. But that's such an important feature to me that it should be the first button in the right-click context menu.\n\nI love the beautiful animations and the automatic visual formatting, but I feel less productive than I do on GitLab's built-in editor. It also has features that I would like... that do not function on Linux solely because of how they were implemented (for example, transluscent windows). The fact that they force you to use their built-in window decorations (that are very Windows-esque) does not give me confidence that they are interested in implementing those features for Linux. If I had to guess, they used libraries that are not supported on Linux to achive those things. So adding support would likely mean rewriting the features or adding OS-specific code for Linux, utilizing compatible libraries. I guess adding \"Not supported on Linux\" to a label is easier than that.\n\nWhat I settled on in the meantime is Apostrophe. It uses GTK, so it works really well on Linux and plays relatively nice with custom window decorations, icons, and themes. It has a half-width preview mode (half the screen is source, the other half is the preview), which I actually prefer over the live preview (this is just preference). Then, I can just right click a header, click \"Inspect Element\", right click the HTML element it highlights, hover over \"Copy\", and click \"Selector Path\". In my opinion, this is how it should be. Intuitive. Either by design or by copying existing paradigms (like web browsers). I'm leaving this comparison here so that hopefully the Obsidian devs can take that feedback and make it much more intuitive to achieve something that I do really frequently whenever I'm editing markdown files.\n\nMy biggest problem with Obsidian is that it feels really useful and polished (the animations are really slick), but it also feels like it's getting in my way. Like, I'm sure it has a ton of features... but they're all buried seemingly for the sake of aesthetics.
