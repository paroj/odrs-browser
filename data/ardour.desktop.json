Now that I have abandoned Windows for good, I need to get a new \"workflow\" that doesn't involved only Reaper. \nI found Ardour6 very easy to switch to, first off, and have worked on a couple projects as tests in Ardour, and found it to be very capable DAW. \n\nWhat has BLOWN me away though, is that somehow when using my Zoom R24 as a USB Audio Interface, instead of having only the MAIN L/R OUTPUT as the audio that gets received by the DAW, it's actually showing me all 8 MICROPHONE/XLR inputs! \n\nThe R24 is a sweet little unit with 8 XLR+1/4\" combo inputs.\n\nThe specs for the Zoom R24 is that all 8 mics get \"mixed\" to Stereo Output that goes over USB to the DAW input. \n\n I've used this Zoom R24 with multiple Windows machines, and only had the Stereo output available as a source. \n\nNow with Ardour6, I am able to record the mic inputs to separate tracks! \n\nI tested with my guitar (split into two signal chains) and a vocal mic, so 3 inputs, and was able to record all 3 into Ardour6 onto their own tracks.\n\nOnly Ardour6 DAW sees it. Any other DAW I've tried to use the Zoom R24 as the Audio Interface... just the main stereo output \n\nHow is this possible? Maybe I misunderstood the capabilities of my equipment all these years?

The team behind Ardour have every reason to be proud, as this is definitely able to compete with Cubase, Pro Tools and all the rest. And it's free!\n\nThe UI is functional, and what you would expect from a professional-level DAW. It has all the usual bells and whistles along with some cool design choices that I like. For example, the partitioning of tracks and Mixer into two totally separate environments is a small stroke of genious in my book, and allows for a more clean workspace. I have done audio and MIDI recording, editing and processing along with sending to dedicated buses for FX or external devices. And I have only begun to scratch the surface of this beast.\n\nBecause of the extreme versatility of the program, the learning curve is as expected pretty steep, and the manual is not the first place I would search for answers. But stick with it, and you have an immensely powerful tool at your disposal.\n\nPros:\n-Full MIDI implementation (send, receive, compose, FX)\n-FX sends and processors, with plugin support (lots of incuded FX plugins!)\n-Wide array of monitoring capabilities for mixing/mastering\n-Plug & play on external devices (MIDI controllers, synthesizers, soundcards)\n-UI is actually not that bad (love the Editor/Mixer partitioning)\n-absolutely love the \"tap tempo\" option for setting project tempo\n\nCons:\n-No factory default export to mp3\n-MIDI Note Off seems a little buggy (stuck notes -needs further testing)\n-As with other DAWS I've tried except FL Studio, it hogs the sound driver, so no other program can use it", "distro": "Debian GNU/Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 162181, "score": 0, "summary": "Ardour means passion", "user_display": "Mikkel Olsen", "version": "5.12.0"}, {"app_id": "ardour.desktop", "date_created": 1590925706.0, "description": "but it's very hard", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 221115, "score": 0, "summary": "amazing", "user_display": "rashed", "version": "5.12.0"}, {"app_id": "ardour.desktop", "date_created": 1591570617.0, "description": "It seemed to be functioning but I could not get any sound out of it.

Pro Tools, which Ardour is a direct competitor to, was a freaking mess when I tried it and lacked seemingly essential features. Ardour behaves similarly to Pro Tools, except it dodges ridiculous issues like poor performance, frequent crashing, and the inability to freely bind MIDI controls.\n\n\tArdour has a fairly clean and usable interface and workflow, though you'll have to get used to it. If you haven't used a DAW before, don't expect to be able to jump right in easily.\n\n\tArdour has great support for standards, allowing the use of LV2, VST, and LADSPA plugins. It supports JACK, ALSA, and Pulseaudio on Linux, as well as the respective sound systems of Windows and Mac. It supports any sound card or audio interface that your OS supports. You can access automatic bindings for many MIDI controllers, or create bindings manually for uncommon devices.\n\n\tThe interface is a simple one-window interface by default. Selecting a track will reveal its mixer strip. You edit MIDI directly in the timeline. You can use and detach a separate mixer window like is the default in Pro Tools if you want.\n\n\tArdour also comes with basic plugins for composing and mixing.\n\nI should address a few complaints that I frequently see about Ardour:\n\n\"Ardour isn't free software, you have to pay for binaries!\": First of all, you only need to pay for binaries if you are getting them directly from ardour.org. You don't have to pay a penny for the binaries in repositories. Second, \"free\" is an older term that refers to freedom, not price. Think of Ardour as an \"open-source\" application.\n\n\"I can't get it to load a session\" or \"it won't play any sound\": You need to properly configure your audio server and settings. ALSA is the most fail-proof option to choose when loading Ardour. If JACK gives you issues, configure it for real-time processing. These issues are not Ardour's problem.\n\n\"Ardour is clunky and hard to use\" : Even if you already use a DAW you still need to put work into learning Ardour's interface. This goes for any professional software.\n\n\"It won't open\" or \"this is broken, it crashes all the time\" : It might not be compiled correctly. If you compiled it yourself, make sure you are using the correct versions of the libraries that are recommended by the developers. If you are using a binary compiled for your OS, try compiling it yourself or using the official binaries.
