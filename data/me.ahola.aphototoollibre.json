The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the fact that you can only load images one at a time and you cannot select all image extensions. If you only need to fix small amounts of photos this might be a good fit as opposed to more complex programs.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 3, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 567411, "score": 13, "summary": "Great for really quick simple photo edits", "user_display": "Charles Nichols", "version": "1.0.5"}]
