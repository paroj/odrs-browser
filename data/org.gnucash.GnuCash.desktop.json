Then I looked at mobile apps like 'you need a budget'. All of these are easier to learn but then I heard so much good about this. So I tried it out. Didn't understand at first. Then I read the documentation and followed the guide. The main reason I found it hard to understand at first is that it is a double entry accounting system. This is actually the biggest strength yet turned out to be the single most important thing to understand. Like the documentation says under 'Accounting Concepts'. Try to make sure you understand that before going on. If you still don't understand and find yourself lost in the application. Go back to that. You most likely didn't get it even though you thought you did.\n\nOnce you get it this tool is absolutely amazing. The details. Incredible. The year-end reports. Amazing. Sure could they be more modern and flashy. Absolutely, but don't just wish. Make it so. Gnu cash has all the data. Make a plugin or contribute with those flashy year-end summaries and statistics generators. Think of this as your giant transaction database. As long as you fill it in you can do all kinds of amazing things in the future. You can also have your stocks listed in here with the perl plugin. I use Yahoo to get and update exchange rates automatically. That works great but that really does need quite a lot of manual work to function. It at least wasn't that plug and play for me. \n\nGnuCash also has a mobile app in case you need such a thing.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 1, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 28784, "score": 0, "summary": "Increadible", "user_display": "gustaf", "version": "3.5"}, {"app_id": "org.gnucash.GnuCash", "date_created": 1575467827.0, "description": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to make accounting intuitive, but GnuCash has managed to make a fairly intuitive interface with a moderately shallow learning curve.
