Don't expect all kinds of features, but that can be a good thing. If you simply want to play your music and get the job done in a clean, straightforward manner, this app might be ideal for you.\n\nI've tried/tinkered with just about every music player there is (in Windows about a decade ago when that is all I had to use) and within the Linux ecosystem. So many good choices around and there's nothing wrong with installing multiple players for whatever suits your mood and intentions at the time.\n\nI'll be keeping Musicly on my computer (Linux Lite 5.8) and looking forward to any potential updates and added features. As a plain-Jane player, it's a worthy app if you just want something to quickly play music and have a pleasant interface to deal with.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 583905, "score": 0, "summary": "Seems like early days..", "user_display": "Norm Meunier", "version": "0.4.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.musicly-gg6r4YP38WTiRcyO772M1HvBZ1pyAiI7", "date_created": 1685646813.0, "description": "For me it, when it worked it was too basic.
