Here is what I did:\n\n1. Remove the antenna from the radio\n2. Plug the USB cable into my Ubuntu computer and into the radio\n3. Turn on the power to the radio and set the volume to about 60%\n4. Enable all permissions for Chirp in the Snap store\n5. Followed the First Time and Additional Notes from the product description by typing two commands into the shell:\n\n\t$ sudo snap connect chirp-snap:raw-usb\n\t$ sudo snap alias chirp-snap chirp\n\n6. Determined which USB device the radio is connected to by examining the output by typing this command into the shell:\n\n\t$ dmesg\n\n7. Enabled communication between the computer and the radio by typing this command into the shell:\n\n\t$ sudo addgroup \"$USERNAME\" dialout\n\n8. Rebooted my computer to make the previous step take effect.\n9. Start the program though the Ubuntu GUI; OR by typing this command into the shell:\n\n\t$ /snap/bin/chirp\n\n10. Select Radio > Download From Radio, select the correct USB port as determined in step 6, select the brand and model.\n\nThe current programming loaded into Chirp and I figured out how to update the radio's programming. I felt successful.\n\n[Some of these steps I gleaned from watching YouTube videos on this program]", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 505591, "score": 10, "summary": "I'm a total newbie to this program.
