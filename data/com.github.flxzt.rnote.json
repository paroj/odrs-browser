I was looking for something like Miro for sketching wireframes and using as a virtual infinite notepad. This app is really perfect for that. Looks incredible, easy to use, thoughtfully designed. The keyboard shortcut dialog was particularly helpful. \n\nMy only trouble was working out how to pan around the canvas. I'm using a pen tablet to draw shapes and write, so don't have my mouse or touchpad by my hand. The pen buttons didn't trigger a pan action, neither did the Spacebar (which is how Inkscape, Miro, Figma, Affinity Suite behave), and I couldn't find the pan tool till later (tap the \"Wrench\" tool then the \"Move\" tool). But I found that you have to hold down Alt to pan. This is the first application I've encountered that uses Alt to pan which I find jarring, but otherwise I love the app.\n\nThanks so much!", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 615972, "score": 0, "summary": "Incredibly good", "user_display": "Chris Wood", "version": "0.9.4"}, {"app_id": "com.github.flxzt.rnote", "date_created": 1710405608.0, "description": "Not much to say.
