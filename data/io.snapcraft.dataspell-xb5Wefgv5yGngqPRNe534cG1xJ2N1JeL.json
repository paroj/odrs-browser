I've bought an AZERTY keyboard but I change the language to English and it's QWERTY layout. for some reason when I try anyshortcut like CTRL+ Z DataSpell deosn't \"change\" the keyboard layout. (so I code using QWERTY layout but use shortcuts with AZERTY) which is a little annoeying.\n2. For some reason the R compiler stopped working and I had to re-download RStudio to finish my work.
