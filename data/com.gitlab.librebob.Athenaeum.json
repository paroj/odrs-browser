With Athenaeum, I\u2019ve found the ideal replacement for Lutris.\n\nWhat makes Athenaeum great is that it allows me to install, update, and launch all of my Flatpak games in one location. Not only does Athenaeum have all of the features of the gnome software-center (screenshots, description, developer links, etc.), but it also has a game recommendation system that\u2019s similar to a platform like Steam. It makes discovering new games much more convenient in comparison with the gnome software-center.\n\nThe only downside with Athenaeum is that you can\u2019t group games by Genre. \n\nApart from the minor downside with genre-grouping, I strongly recommend Athenaeum.
