All the functions I\u2019ve tested have performed well. The app is simple, but well thought-out with lots of great, useful features.\n__________\n\nFrom the computer, I can ping my phone, ring my phone, receive phone notifications and delete them, carry on SMS/MMS conversations (I noticed the conversation are labeled by phone number rather than by Contact name, but I chose not to enable the Contact Synchronizer, so that might be the reason), transfer files by browsing for a file or via drag and drop.\n\nBrowsing the contents of the phone from the computer worked particularly well. You can select \u201cBrowse this device\u201d in KDE Connect, which opens the computer\u2019s file manager (Dolphin), or open the file manager, then select the device. All the features of the file manager seemed to work with the phone.\n__________\n\nFrom the phone, I can issue certain commands to the computer (e.g. Lock/unlock the screen), I can use my phone\u2019s screen as a mouse to move the cursor and select items, send the text contents of the phone clipboard to the computer clipboard, transfer files to the computer with the KDE Connect\u2019s Send File button.\n\nI can control media (Elisa, Clementine, VLC, and Glenview tested) on the computer using the phone (play, pause, stop, fast forward, rewind, next track, previous track). In order to create a play list, open a file, or open a media app on the computer, I was able to use the Remote Input option (cursor control) on the phone. If you start a slideshow in Glenview, you can control the slideshow using this Media control feature.\n\nThe \u201cSlideshow Remote\u201d feature worked very well from the phone: easily move forwards and backwards through slides; \u201cFullscreen\u201d starts the presentation and \u201cExit presentation\u201d returns to your presentation application (I tested Softmaker Presentations and Libre Office Impress). The pointer function is pretty cool: hold down the Pointer button on your phone, then move your phone around to move the circular pointer over your slide.\n\nThe Slideshow feature works somewhat in file manager, Dolphin, but doesn\u2019t really work with Gwenview the picture viewer (use Media control instead). In the Firefox browser, the current tab will refresh if you select the \u201cFullscreen\u201d option.\n__________\n\nThere were a number of permissions I had to grant to the phone App, but these permissions make sense for the the functions to be performed. Granting fewer permissions limited some options, but other options worked fully. I felt I could customize the permissions within my comfort range and have the functionality I desired.\n\nI did get an error while browsing the phone from the computer when my phone went into sleep mode: \u201cError when accessing filesystem. sshfs finished with exit code 1\u201d I could still use other features of KDE Connect, but couldn\u2019t browse the phone until I restarted the computer.\n__________\n\nMy setup: Kubuntu 22.04 LTS on a Toshiba Satellite Laptop; Android 14 a on Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 612535, "score": 0, "summary": "Highly Recommended", "user_display": "Phillip Bohning", "version": "21.12.3-0ubuntu1"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1707467418.0, "description": "Sharing files between all the devices that's connected to the same WiFi isn't easies than this.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 614152, "score": 0, "summary": "Made my life easier", "user_display": "Tsuriki", "version": "23.08.4-1.fc39"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1680735518.0, "description": "Descubrir esto fue un salto cualitativo, total conectividad con tu m\u00f3vil de manera instant\u00e1nea.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "es_ES.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 578706, "score": 0, "summary": "De 10", "user_display": "\u00c1lvaro", "version": "22.12.3"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1720890794.0, "description": "Id\u00e9e super bien, super pratique mais se d\u00e9connecte facilement.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_FR.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 627482, "score": 31, "summary": "Super appli", "user_display": "Elio", "version": "24.05.0"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1716699604.0, "description": "Excellente application, le seul regret ne pas pouvoir acc\u00e9der au r\u00e9pertoire, Android/data, dans ces cas-l\u00e0, je suis oblig\u00e9 de passer par le c\u00e2ble.", "distro": "openSUSE Tumbleweed", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_FR", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 623399, "score": 14, "summary": "Acc\u00e8s au repertoire data", "user_display": "Andre Ray", "version": "24.02.2-1.1"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1671973207.0, "description": "linux mint 21.1 cinnamon 5.6.5 6.0.9 generic", "distro": "Linux Mint", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "ru_RU.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 550754, "score": 0, "summary": "\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041d\u041e \u041d\u0415 \u0420\u0410\u0411\u041e\u0422\u0410\u0415\u0422", "user_display": "MINT", "version": "22.04.3"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1679127172.0, "description": "Notifications from computer to phone not working.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "ru_UA.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 573843, "score": 0, "summary": "Practically Works (almost)", "user_display": "admin", "version": "22.12.3"}, {"app_id": "org.kde.kdeconnect", "date_created": 1696066419.0, "description": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435???", "distro": "ALT Workstation", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "ru_RU.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 602847, "score": 0, "summary": "\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a", "user_display": null, "version": "p10"}]
