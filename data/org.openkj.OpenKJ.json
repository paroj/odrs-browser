It does nearly everything something like CompUHost would do, but is faster, lighter-weight, and free.\n\nMy only criticism is that for some strange reason, Lightburn has included the option to display the next singer up between songs on the CDG display window, but this can only be used if you set the show to run itself automatically instead of manually.\n\nSo, if you set up OpenKJ to run the next singer/song's track automatically after 30 seconds, during those 30 seconds a nice \"Next up: Jane (or whomever)\" will appear on the main display, but there is no way to display this message unless you give up control of when songs begin.\n\nWhy limit this basic, necessary functionality in this way if you're already going to bother including it?", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 526651, "score": 33, "summary": "Does almost everything you could ever need", "user_display": "lividliquid", "version": "2.0.8"}, {"app_id": "org.openkj.OpenKJ", "date_created": 1662742079.0, "description": "you have to buy songs. cannot play from your file list.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_IN", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 517871, "score": 24, "summary": "commercial software", "user_display": "Cruzader", "version": "2.0.8 (stable)"}, {"app_id": "org.openkj.OpenKJ", "date_created": 1630365760.0, "description": "Now I can ditch the windows laptop since it was the only way to do Karaoke.
