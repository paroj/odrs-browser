Do not pay attention to the reviews that say you have to purchase songs and cannot use your own, that is simply not true. This software will play almost anything you throw at it regardless of format or where you got it.\nIt has all of the best features required by most KJ's in the business.\nOf course, no program is perfect and there are a couple of tweaks I would like to see but nothing that makes it a deal breaker. I have been using this program for a very very long time and it has never let me down yet.\nOn a personal note, I spoke with Isaac several times directly before his untimely passing and can tell you that this was his passion and he always strived to give everyone what they wanted and paid attention to ever comment people gave him. I miss him and will continue to use the software for the long haul. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL KJ's. Not for the casual KJ or home user.

I use it every weekend and am reminded quite often just how talented he was and that he was taken too early in life.\nI hope someday, someone will come across his legacy and pickup where he left off. He was always looking for ways to improve OpenKJ and it was always being tweaked or he was testing different ideas. It may seem incomplete because it is. But what he left us still works 2 years later.
