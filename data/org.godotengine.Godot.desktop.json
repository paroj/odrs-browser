implementation thanks to GDScript, which is so tightly integrated with the engine internals.\n\nGodot is often compared to Unity, but feature-wise it's not quite the same. If you need to go more advanced, Godot may not always offer a complete solution that could allow to solve specific use cases easier. Things like usability are always preferred over performance, and if there's a doubt whether to make something configurable or not, Godot core developers will likely decide on the latter - \"It's too specific\", they say.\n\nDue to extremely pragmatic nature of Godot's development process, some features may get overly simplified in the interest of achieving good looking results that don't require spending hours or days to implement compared to other (commercial) engines, and it's a trade-off that Godot core developers deliberately choose to accept, yet this kind of approach may not be clear to existing Godot audience that haven't yet needed more than they currently use in their projects, which may lead to disappointment at some point in the future.\n\nGladly, the engine has ability to extend its core features via C++ modules and GDNative that allow to alleviate existing limitations yourself. If you plan to use Godot in the long term, be prepared to the possibility that you may need maintain your custom version of the engine, and that requires the knowledge of C++ development.\n\nThis review is based on my own experience using the engine and contributing to Godot's development myself for the past 4 years.
