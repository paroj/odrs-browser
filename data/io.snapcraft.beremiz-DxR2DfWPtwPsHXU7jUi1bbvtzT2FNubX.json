The set-up was just what I need to start off the logic blocks. For about two and a Half on how I was going to it. If it wasn't software it was hardware. Then I get everthing all set-up-wiredup and program and my hardware and software did not want to talk that. Then I ran into this and got all my logics to run all of my actuator, fan, senors, heatexchangers etc.. I got my wife into programing she got all of our lighting and garage door online and now she is working on the secutity cam's. She went from a Accountant Manager to programing and she blows me out out of the water and I do it for a living. Thank you for giving me and my wife a hobbie we can do together.xs", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 591481, "score": 0, "summary": "love it just what we needed11", "user_display": "Randall Lee Weed Jr", "version": "1.3"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.beremiz-DxR2DfWPtwPsHXU7jUi1bbvtzT2FNubX", "date_created": 1691132527.0, "description": "Unable to create project, error occurred when creating project: 'could not read the contents of XXX'", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 598157, "score": 0, "summary": "Unable to create project", "user_display": "Kenny", "version": "1.3"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.beremiz-DxR2DfWPtwPsHXU7jUi1bbvtzT2FNubX", "date_created": 1717437228.0, "description": "No es posible crear un nuevo proyecto.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "es_ES.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 624042, "score": 24, "summary": "No es posible crear un nuevo proyecto", "user_display": "Zarnx", "version": "1.4"}]
