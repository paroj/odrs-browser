I'm using a 4k monitor with integrated graphics which works fine for even some 3D games. In this case however, the input/rendering lag was much too high initially, even at 640x480. I had to switch to 1080p or 2160p and minimize mouse smoothing to make it playable. But I feel the lag could still be lower when I compare it to games like Xonotic. May be an SDL-based issue, perhaps due to software scaling for non-native resolutions.\nThis game, unlike other games, does not reset my display scale on exit, unless I change the resolution using the config menu.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 400768, "score": 0, "summary": "Nice addition to the game library", "user_display": "maxwell", "version": "1.5"}]
