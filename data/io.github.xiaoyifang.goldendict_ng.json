So 5*. PROBLEM: I have lots of dictionary files. On first scan it works ok. BUT as it is indexing all the texts (over 500MB of my files) it overheats system. CPU temperature goes through the roof! I am Using latest Microsoft Surface Pro with Fedora. Also keeps running in background when indexing & crashes surface pro because temperature gets so hot on back you can fry an egg so it stops charging batttery & fan goes super crazy loud & then auto-shuts down device. When indexing, it Can not be shut-down as it runs as process in background, unless terminate or kill process itself by sys-monitor or command line! Once indexed, it is ok. I advise to tune down the aggressiveness of initial indexing (after rescan) by 1) calculate overall size of files & 2) if files being indexed are over 200mb then less aggressive indexing, ie: do it slower & take longer time, double the time needed. After indexing, it seems OK and no problems anymore. Dark mode & Interface & functioning otherwise is much better than official version of app, so thanks very much.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 610345, "score": 0, "summary": "BEST Version but BIG PROBLEM with initial scan OVER-HEATING", "user_display": "ka", "version": "23.12.23"}]
