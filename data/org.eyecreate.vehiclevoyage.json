The user interface is clean, and using the program's limited set of features is easy; however, the program doesn't provide many functions. You can can vehicles and enter service events, but minor irriations make this tedious work. If you are entering historical records, you will quickly discover that the program does not allow you to manually enter dates and that you must instead enter them through a dialog window, which results in a lot of wasted time clicking to cycle back through time one month at at time. The program does have an import function that supports json files from carfax. This reviewer did not test this particular feature but did note the corresponding lack of any export function which gets to why the program is not workable as it is: once you enter all the information about your vehicles and their service events, the program gives you no means to search, filter, or generate reports.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "es_US.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 599393, "score": 0, "summary": "Nice idea, but not really funtional", "user_display": "mikey", "version": "1.1"}]
