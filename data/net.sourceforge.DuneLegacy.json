[{"app_id": "net.sourceforge.DuneLegacy.desktop", "date_created": 1675420885.0, "description": "Dune II has been one off my all time favorite RTS games since I first played it. I always remember being disappointed by the CD-ROM FMV style game vs. Westwood's excellent RTS and always came back to this game back in the day. I went back and played it on DOSBox a few years ago and was able to install from my original disks, but admittadly the original experience is not as fluid as modern RTS games with right click functionality.\n\nNot only has this Legacy upgrade made it so you can right click to move units and attack enemies, the UI has been massively improved to enhance the quality of the original game files. It suppors even Ultrawide displays at 1440P on Steam Deck! Absoultely awesome! The HD scaling makes the game look fresh and sharp. I am so happy to have found this. I am going to relive the glory of this game all over again.\n\nI highly recommend giving this a try if you played the original. In case your old disks are not reading well, you can find the required game files (not included) on abandonware and drag + drop the unzipped files into the directory on your SteamDeck (the program provides you with a directory string you can use to quickly find the right folder). \n\nHats off to the devs. Thank you!", "distro": "SteamOS", "karma_down": 1, "karma_up": 1, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 561018, "score": 0, "summary": "Fantastic Upgrade!", "user_display": "UltimateOwnage (Steam Deck User)", "version": "0.96.4"}, {"app_id": "net.sourceforge.DuneLegacy", "date_created": 1700487112.0, "description": "Danke, dass dieses Spiel ins n\u00e4chste Jahrtausend gerettet wurde!", "distro": "Arch Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "de_DE.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 607210, "score": 0, "summary": "Super Spiel", "user_display": null, "version": "0.96.4"}]
