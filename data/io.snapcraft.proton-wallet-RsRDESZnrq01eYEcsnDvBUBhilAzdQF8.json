I even ask for extra hashes and the Edwin is so friendly and more than willing to oblige. One time I asked for network packets and they gave me three. I said, \"Wow, three for free!\" and the nice friendly Edwin Hashius laughed and said, \"I'm going to call you 3-for-free!\".\n\nNow the Edwin greets me with \"hey it's 3-for-free!\" and ALWAYS gives me three TCP packets. It's such a fun and easy atmosphere at my local Turtlecoin discord, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large ambatakum with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great wallet that is fast, fun, and can match my daily crypto sending needs.\n\nI even dip my trtls in Fantom sauce, it's fun, fast, and easy!
