I thought maybe this campaign would serve as a tutorial, but if that was the intention it sure doesn't show. I was at least able to find out how to move and attack, but when I reached level two I only figured out I could repair units after I had blown my entire army fighting my opponent. I know people complain about tutorials that hold your hands too much, but I'd rather have one of those than no tutorial at all.\n\n In addition to that, GUI elements like the one that explains what a button does are located in bad places and take up miniscule amounts of the screen, while the game viewport is so big that the actual map doesn't fill up the entire screen. You've also got features like infantry that can place mines which just confuses new users IMO. A better-designed game puts the simplest units in the hands of a new user, slowly teaching them how to use all of the little features.\n\nI give one star because I do think this could *potentially* get better, but not unless someone makes fixes to simplify everything.\n\nLastly, when I exited the game, it just went black and I had to switch to a TTY and kill it.
