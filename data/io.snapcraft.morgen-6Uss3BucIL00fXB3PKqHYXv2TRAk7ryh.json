Not stand-alone. California? Development has stuck. Gnome calendar? Requires installing Evolution for exchange support and prone to bugs (and I am talking of stuff like the app crashing for months when viewing 2021 events, or wrong time zone on ICS invitations).\n\nIf you are in a position similar to mine, then Morgen is the only available choice: for the fact of being there it gets the 5 stars.\n\nNow, there are a few annoying things:\n\n1) The app is an evolution of the research-oriented MineTime, but oddly enough it lacks some of the features of its progenitors (such as natural text input). Until a months ago or so, it was also a bit less stable and less usable. Thankfully, development is going strong and the app is improving a lot.\n\n2) More annoyingly, the app is not free, and the pricing scheme has changed w.r.t. the MineTime one. In particular, educational licenses used to be free, but this is no longer the case.\n\n3) The fact that MineTime was about to be replaced by a new, more commercially oriented, app was poorly communicated at the time. I kind of knew that was coming (a company needs to sustain itself), but still it took me a while to digest this.\n\nThat said, if you willing to pay the monthly price, this is a great app about to become even better.", "distro": "Manjaro Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 397221, "score": 0, "summary": "The only reliable, stand-alone, multi-protocol calendar app on Linux", "user_display": "Michele Lombardi", "version": "2.1.7"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.morgen-6Uss3BucIL00fXB3PKqHYXv2TRAk7ryh", "date_created": 1627162810.0, "description": "I'm sorry, but I ain't paying for no calendar with so many free alternatives.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 402446, "score": 0, "summary": "Paid Calendar", "user_display": "karol", "version": "2.1.10"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.morgen-6Uss3BucIL00fXB3PKqHYXv2TRAk7ryh", "date_created": 1629186848.0, "description": "Finally a calendar app that looks good on Linux", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 410279, "score": 0, "summary": "Love the great UI", "user_display": "Marco", "version": "2.1.12"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.morgen-6Uss3BucIL00fXB3PKqHYXv2TRAk7ryh", "date_created": 1634266773.0, "description": "By far the best calendar app available, I even use it on my Windows machine as it keeps everything in sync.
