It uses a piano roll-based UI which should be very familiar to anyone who's used a modern DAW before, and should be decently accessible even to people who don't have experience with other chip music programs. It lacks some advanced features that more experienced users of apps like FamiTracker and its many forks might miss (though there are some things that FamiStudio does better!), but the developer is very active and continues to add new features regularly.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 410138, "score": 0, "summary": "A comfy NES/Famicom music creation tool with lots of potential", "user_display": "tromino", "version": "3.1.1"}, {"app_id": "org.famistudio.FamiStudio", "date_created": 1642652867.0, "description": "easy to edit \ngood for begainers who are still learning", "distro": "Endless", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.utf8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 456234, "score": 0, "summary": "would recomend", "user_display": "Isamu Downey", "version": "3.2.2"}, {"app_id": "org.famistudio.FamiStudio", "date_created": 1650809823.0, "description": "in papermint 10 ( dell Inspiron 3558 )", "distro": "Peppermint", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 480966, "score": 0, "summary": "black screen", "user_display": "safehouse", "version": "3.2.3"}, {"app_id": "org.famistudio.FamiStudio", "date_created": 1703011421.0, "description": "3eeedeeocme0xme0x,eox,wxow,xo", "distro": "SteamOS", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 609734, "score": 0, "summary": "eeeedjdejcjricnricneixmeixmeic", "user_display": "Steam Deck User", "version": "4.1.3"}]
