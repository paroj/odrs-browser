I've used monday and asana, but both kinda sucked. Monday wasn't free and i found that out the hard way when i lost all of my reminders because i didn't pay. Asana doesn't have a desktop app and doesn't actually look that good either. I haven't really had any issues with Clickup so far. Most of it is intuitive and easy to get started with. It does get more complex if you want it to be; this includes columns and integrations (clickup's term for outside software like discord, github, or google calendar) which makes everything more organized and only takes a day or two to learn.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 2, "karma_up": 36, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 311740, "score": 62, "summary": "nice, mostly free, reminder service", "user_display": "Charlie", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.clickup-xe8ipN3qHAHT3Bmfv4CI21Ptt918kl9O", "date_created": 1614775780.0, "description": "Just works\nDoes exactly what it's supposed to do", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_IL", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 347491, "score": 0, "summary": "Does exactly what it's supposed to do", "user_display": "omer", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.clickup-xe8ipN3qHAHT3Bmfv4CI21Ptt918kl9O", "date_created": 1620639340.0, "description": "Simple, but useful little solution.
