For example, it has been having a serious issue causing the cursor to become in drag-and-drop mode, which prevents the user from doing anything useful with the app. The app has sync annoyances and issues and a lot of times my documents end up unsynced or not even found because of the bad syncing design, which also affects the browsers' extensions experience. The app does not automatically adapt in the best way to screen size, does not easily snap, does not have proper shortcuts support, and has UI and UX issues e.g. when searching, it does not allow syncing locally without account, invades privacy by liberally handling the uploaded files' (meta)data, and is not even open source. It also does not support Google Docs which is extremely common and supported by open competitors. People might enjoy some of its unique features (e.g. 2GB online library), but it is still a relatively bad app. It is not that bad, however, for people who do not intend to invest a lot in it and only intent to use it for minor instances and short research.
