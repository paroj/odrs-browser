Add a bible and read it by switching between books/chapters. Nothing more, nothing less. However, there are so many sloppy UI decisions, that it's ultimately pretty bad.\n\n-) buttons always span entire window width\n-) the bible language selection opens a dropdown lists with hundreds of language tokens (no search)\n-) no obvious way to exit the \"Install new mods\" section (you have to select a new bible passage)\n-) doesn't remember last language selection after you exit\n-) 2 side-by-side scrollable lists to choose book and chapter\n-) text size gets adjusted with a slider (instead of setting the point size)\n-) text formatting gets dictated by the source text\n-) layout is reminiscent of unformatted HTML\n-) no keyboard shortcuts for switching books/chapters\n\nIt also crashed repeatedly for me while trying to download new bibles/refreshing sources.\n\nA real shame, because with a bit of work this program could be really good. But with the last commit being more than a year ago, I fear that this work will never be done.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 250344, "score": 0, "summary": "Simple, but sloppy", "user_display": "Markus E.
