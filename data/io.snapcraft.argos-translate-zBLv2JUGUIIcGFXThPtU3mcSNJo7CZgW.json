This is the translator for you. Install it. Use it. Enjoy it. You will not be disappointed.\n\nTranslation is carried out continuously, so the translated language is seen developing and changing context while you type, which I found interesting and useful, especially regarding the checking of context\n\nArgos Translator has a simple interface, face and quite accurate. Plus, I understand it has the ability to work off line - although I've not tested that function.\n\nSo far all is good.\n\nAlthough it took a while to install - (probably because of the various language packs), the Translator installed and runs without a hitch.\n\nHowever, a search on Github (Nov 2020) does not reveal any additional language packs either available or under development, so 'Glate' will still have to remain as my principle translator, since it does not cover the languages for which I often need an accurate translation. - Dutch, Italian and some of the Scandinavian languages.\n\nI would have given 5 stars but had to knock of a couple because of the very limited number of languages available. With greater language support the software deserves five stars at least.\n\nLets hope the developer(s) take this as encouragement to provide greater language support because this has the core of a really GOOD translating package\n\nAlternatively, somebody else should be able to provide just the additional language packs for this translator.\n\nKeep up the good work. I am truly sorry that I shall probably uninstall it because although I love the way Argos Translator works, I really don't need two translators.\n\nThisisi", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 306108, "score": 0, "summary": "Very good translator but with limited available languages", "user_display": "This is I", "version": "1.0.3"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.argos-translate-zBLv2JUGUIIcGFXThPtU3mcSNJo7CZgW", "date_created": 1605889677.0, "description": "\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 306218, "score": 0, "summary": "\u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e", "user_display": "cyrill", "version": "1.0.3"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.argos-translate-zBLv2JUGUIIcGFXThPtU3mcSNJo7CZgW", "date_created": 1610412897.0, "description": "Finally, an Offline Mode translator that produces good translations!
