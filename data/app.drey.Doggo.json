The dog will either be happy with your pets, feel bored or tired, or have a heart attack. The dog will either like your food, hate it, or die. Abandoning the dog quits the app. Clicker just lets you click and does nothing for the dog. This app should show the dog graphically and their mood, rather than just relying on text. The UX is bad. Selecting any actions of Petting, feeding, abandoning, or clicking minimizes the menu where you select your actions, so you need to use the back button on your mouse to bring it up or press Alt + Left arrow.", "distro": "openSUSE Tumbleweed", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 624493, "score": 23, "summary": "Very basic", "user_display": "PenguinGamer", "version": "46.1"}, {"app_id": "app.drey.Doggo", "date_created": 1717358791.0, "description": "Such a lovely little game!", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 623977, "score": 14, "summary": "Amazing", "user_display": "Afonso Basilio", "version": "46.1"}, {"app_id": "app.drey.Doggo", "date_created": 1711096604.0, "description": "Better than all games relased the last 5 years", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_CH.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 617936, "score": 0, "summary": "10/10 GOTY", "user_display": "MiMillie", "version": "46.0"}]
