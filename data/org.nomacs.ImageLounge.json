I needed a borderless display for images to stream. Voila, nomacs does borderless! Perfect, what could go wrong? Select borderless, Shazam! No borders. Also no 80% of your screen and no access to any other program because it floats on top! I mean if I am displaying an image, I want it one inconvenient size, right? Don't want to be able to resize the image when frameless. And they thoughfully insured that no matter how you size it before going frameless BOOM! Right back to the giant economy block o apps size!  Besides that, it's great. Just like all the other Linux apps, they're fine, except for that one little thing that makes them unusable for what you need. On the plus side, it is hundreds of dollars less then Windows which has the same issues. I will see if I can put in a feature request or find a way around this.
