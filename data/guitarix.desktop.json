AT ALL.\nJACK (in qjackctl, which guitarix uses by default) is pretty finnickey, I spent hours trying to make it work. I was able to get it to play nice after lots of fiddling with soundcard switching and searching online for guides.. but after a long struggle with qjackctl crashing constantly, I switched to cadence which helped significantly (no fussing with patching/connecting NAMELESS DEVICES into each other)(no seriously, qjackctl has you fiddle with things like input_1, input_2, output_1 to 4, I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH SOUND OUTPUT/INPUT IS WHICH..) but then i had problems starting and stopping JACK services. Once i had spent hours trying to get everything to work properly and with little to no delay from my instrument to the speaker, I was left with the daunting task of setting up a cabinet from scratch in guitarix.\n\nAnd at that point it wasn't worth it any more.\n\nI installed Tonelib GFX instead of all of this headache stuff and had that program up and running after 3 minutes of instrument delay tweaking. \n\nIn conclusion, to the developers: if you can, try to move away from JACK, or at the very least qjackctl, Jack's only powerful when it actually works.. and for god sakes, put some pre-built cabinet rigs in by default please, there's loads of pedals and stuff available and that's great, but it means nothing to me if i have no examples on how to use them properly or what they sound like..", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 120789, "score": 0, "summary": "Would have been good if it didn't rely so heavily on other software", "user_display": "Partack", "version": "0.36.1"}, {"app_id": "guitarix.desktop", "date_created": 1585902409.0, "description": "This has become a reliable piece of software, with sound modulation that feels like using an amplifier, with the low latency of an amplifier.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_AU", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 175599, "score": 0, "summary": "Yes", "user_display": "human", "version": "0.36.1"}, {"app_id": "guitarix.desktop", "date_created": 1588759653.0, "description": "Finally decided to remove it.
