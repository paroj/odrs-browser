I know this is a bit unconventional, but unfortunately I cannot find a way to respond to your reviews.\nI just wanted to inform you all that this issue is not on my end, but Snapcraft's. To resolve this, you must manually give Pigmeat the `process-control` permission.\nThis can be done like so: 'snap connect pigmeat:process-control'\nOnce again, apologies for the confusion. I've been in contact with the folks over at Snapcraft to get this automatically done, as I'm not in control of this.\n\nAlso, to the jokester who left that 'funny' review, you're actually devaluing and harming the fight against racial injustice. Grow up and realize there are actual issues worth fighting for instead of turning everything into a joke.\n\nThank you, and I hope the software works once you've resolved the permissions errors.
