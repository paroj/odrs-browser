Would be cool if it picked up on that, and then suggested I add it back to help organization. I have got pdf and epub if it could show metadata alongside filenames that would cool... I'm viewing this on desktop so on mobile some of these features would be harder to handle. I'm thinking have it like a drop down feature where you can see the metadata when you click the drop down or attached to the top there is a drop down \"all\" button. obviously thumbnails could be cool. This app has potential... I would like the option to get this as a deb package as well though not just flatpack", "distro": "Debian GNU/Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 479502, "score": 0, "summary": "Something That Could Really Good", "user_display": "Busterbeam", "version": "0.201"}]
