My complaints: 1) The packager just doesn't care, the update before last the game didn't even start and now you're presented with a giant red error when you start the game. 2) Lots of updates break save games, meaning you lose weeks or even months of game play and have start from the beginning all over again. This is a nice game but the disruptive development and packaging process means you'll never be able to make real progress as a player.
