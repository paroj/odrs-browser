I AM looking for something in Linux that will remember each folder's position, view, size, (or even only the folders you ask it to remember). I am also looking for a way to put my own icons on things (apps, files, folders) and an icon editor. If all the icons look identical, especially on the bar when there is not even any text to differentiate them from one another, icons are pretty useless in Linux. XP was the best OS (file manager-wise, as well as user control of everything!) I've ever used. I could easily disable peer-to-peer and remote access. So far, nothing in Linux is easy.
