PhotoNotebook is basic. Not a splendid design. But that's not the point and best feature. It helps you annotate every picture you have with great detail. It also list meta data extensively. If you have a large project with pictures; I can only recommend this software. I tested it on Ubuntu 22 lts. Photo album software is too complicated and expensive to annotate 1000 photo's or more. I hope the software will be developed further. I am quite happy with it. Thank you for the effort. Those who cannot code or do not have enough skills have to rely on others making an effort. This software helped me out a lot. :-)", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 13, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 534817, "score": 57, "summary": "Simple effective piece of software to quickly annotate your photos", "user_display": "mesmoiron", "version": "2.0.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.photonotebook-Pwk8nAz0LzxEYRh1qSf7LSzaNIEe8pIq", "date_created": 1700783303.0, "description": "Couldn't import a JPG and is asking to load a script everytime it's openned.
