The fantasy elements are base off of J.R.R. Tolkien's world of Lord of the Rings to a degree, and the multitudes of troops are well animated and backed with interesting (albeit made up) lore and tales. The strategy is not an afterthought; through simple troop abilities the battles can become very interesting indeed, and it is quite enjoyable. Wesnoth also has a very active community.
