Because of this, once I heard what Playhouse was, I was really excited to try it.\n\nAfter using it for a bit, I'm noticed the following:\n\n01. The app still has a lot of bugs. After changing the devtools' alignment the whole app crashes.\n\n02. The user cannot change the font size in the HTML, CSS & JavaScript editors. This feature is so basic that I'm surprised they developed the app without considering this.\n\n03. Lack of Emmet-like features, helping the user write code quickly via auto-complete and intelligent suggestions.\n\nRight now I'm uninstalling the app but I will try it again later to see how much it has improved. I personally feel that the app has a great potential, but right now it's too young and unrefined.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_IN.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 531664, "score": 31, "summary": "App has great potential but lacks a few fundamental features", "user_display": "Chinmay Ghule", "version": "1.0"}, {"app_id": "re.sonny.Playhouse", "date_created": 1665859304.0, "description": "Does a very good job at openning.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 529096, "score": 23, "summary": "opens", "user_display": "Jack", "version": "1.0"}, {"app_id": "re.sonny.Playhouse", "date_created": 1665001328.0, "description": "Will not open.
