Occasionally the sanbox can cause a problem that needs an experienced user to trouble shoot with a program update. The developer usually fixes the problem in the next iteration. \n\nWith a little learning the security this sandbox can provide is incredible. You can run software natively (without a virtualbox) and present, for example, an empty home directory to the program -- protecting all of your files in case of a bug.\n\nThis program automatically blocks all directories to firefox so if a bug is exploited only the downloads folder is visible, severely mitigating the flaw. The sandbox also reduces the kernel surface. \n\nFantastic software, can't say enough. Massive security improvement on top of linux's already good security.
