Since it doesn't overwrite the original file, this made it really easy to tweak the quality setting of the offending files and get their compressed filesize down. \n\nThe app even detected which settings had changed, so instead of processing the whole batch again, it just processed the images which I'd changed the settings for. Super efficient.\n\nIt worked really quickly, was really easy to use, and had everything I needed. The image resizing tool and ability to drag-and-drop files in was much appreciated as well.\n\nThank you!", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 613495, "score": 0, "summary": "Great for batch converting to WebP", "user_display": "Chris Wood", "version": "1.2.3"}, {"app_id": "org.flozz.yoga-image-optimizer", "date_created": 1638267560.0, "description": "Program does not write optimized file to file system.
