But today, with Steam allow us to play actual SM CIv games on Linux this has no point other than being a Free \"version\" of the same basic premises. \n\nIn addition, the game has not kept up with the times and it can be attributed to the failure of the concept of \"Open Source\" not working in the area of Video Games. For-profit VG developers have a saying, \"At some point, you must ship\" meaning at some point the game needs to be declared finished and submitted for the market's approval or disapproval. Freeciv sadly has remained in what feels like an Beta if not late Alpha stage for over a decade if not two. It is highly likely major innovation/overhaul needs to happen for the game to be relevant in today's gaming space, or needs to be put down.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 53673, "score": 0, "summary": "There are better options", "user_display": "Samuel Lancaster", "version": "2.5.10"}, {"app_id": "freeciv.desktop", "date_created": 1567483483.0, "description": "The lettering is small and I couldn't make it bigger.
