It supports OpenAI but that requires a token while its default provider is \"Stable Diffusion\"(whatever that is). Anyway Stable Diffusion seems to be free, but if you try it a bit too much, like 7-9 times it will give you a message that you are rate limited. \n\nThe app itself does not seem to collect any info about you since, after I moved to internet cafe, since they have another IP, I discovered in the other cafe that I was no longer limited...so its good the app does not spy on you and doesn't track you. It is licensed with GPLv3 or later which is good. It's FOSS.\n\nIf you want to use an imaginative AI that doesn't require a registration or a log in, this app is for you. I did not need to register in order to use it, I could use it right away after installing. If this is not the case for you, please provide your own review detailing your experience.\n\nThanks for your time!", "distro": "SteamOS", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 6, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 595940, "score": 30, "summary": "No registration required", "user_display": "Steam Deck User", "version": "0.2.2"}, {"app_id": "page.codeberg.Imaginer.Imaginer", "date_created": 1683395878.0, "description": "There are a lot of issues.

It's refreshing to have AI apps available on desktops, as they have mostly been dominant in the mobile space. However, there are areas where the app falls short and it is a waste of your money compared to some engines which are totally free and rendering by far better pictures.\n\nOne aspect that stood out was the quality of picture rendering, which unfortunately lags behind what I've experienced on platforms like Discord, browsers and on other apps. While the app's rendering is satisfactory, there are other AI engines available online that offer superior results for real-life picture rendering, and some even provide this service for free. Therefore, there is room for improvement in this aspect.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, it's clear that the developers are on the right track. The app demonstrates potential and provides a glimpse into what could be achieved with further enhancements. I believe that with continued development and refinement, this app has the potential to become a competitive player in the field of AI picture rendering on desktops.\n\nIn conclusion, the AI picture rendering app shows promise as a desktop solution, but it currently falls short in terms of picture rendering quality compared to certain AI engines. It's commendable that efforts are being made to bring AI applications to desktop platforms, and I encourage the developers to keep refining and enhancing the app to reach its full potential.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 592615, "score": 0, "summary": "Desktop AI Picture Rendering App, but a waste of money", "user_display": "Vasco F.
