Furthermore, manually resolving the dependencies for CoqIDE was time-consuming and error-prone, and I had to manually build and install every external Coq library (e.g. VST) that I wanted to use in my projects.\n\nNow, with the Snap package, all this is done for me with a single click and I don't have to waste CPU cycles building the software since the binaries are included directly within the Snap package. Another advantage is that the platform comes with commonly used third-party libraries by default so I don't have to add them myself.\n\nAs of 31/05/2021, the CoqIDE desktop entry fails to launch CoqIDE, saying that the Exec field is missing, but I can launch it directly from the command line so it isn't a major issue. Overall, I consider this package to be a 9/10 and would definitely recommend to newcomers to Coq over the manual installation method with opam.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 383669, "score": 0, "summary": "Convenient and feature-complete", "user_display": "Donald Sebastian Leung", "version": "2021"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.coq-prover-o6VxNjysVdkpKBde54Vb4BDJdEbcsGpT", "date_created": 1629858703.0, "description": "Have to run it from the command line -coqide-.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 412973, "score": 0, "summary": "My favorite proof assistant", "user_display": "alain", "version": "2021"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.coq-prover-o6VxNjysVdkpKBde54Vb4BDJdEbcsGpT", "date_created": 1664290034.0, "description": "vive les coq", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_FR.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 523348, "score": 0, "summary": "C nul", "user_display": "STUCKI", "version": "2022"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.coq-prover-o6VxNjysVdkpKBde54Vb4BDJdEbcsGpT", "date_created": 1664290197.0, "description": "Un film moyen, dispensable.
