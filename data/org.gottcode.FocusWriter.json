Great work.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 525425, "score": 23, "summary": "Great setup!", "user_display": "Kurt", "version": "1.8.3"}, {"app_id": "focuswriter.desktop", "date_created": 1660330131.0, "description": "I'm using a very recent installation of Ubuntu 18.04. with no frills.\nAs somebody who spends quite a lot of time writing I thought I'd look at Focus Writer.\n\nThe first and the biggest problem for me is the US English Dictionary for spellchecking. Americans have a rather quaint habit of spelling a great many English words incorrectly. Attempting to change the spell check language led me to an \"Add Language\" button. Pressing this simply opened my home directory. Hardly helpful! I shouldn't need to go hunting the internet for a dictionary. Other apps supply a link. The website provided no help at all. Focus Writer may be translated into more than 20 languages! - but UK English is NOT one of them!\n\nSecond problem was the paper size. There was a wealth of paper sizes to select from a drop down menu. Unfortunately whichever I selected didn't change the actual desktop paper size. Changing from A5 to A0 had no effect. It appeared stuck on 'ANSI Letter'. I use A4 which is fairly standard in the UK.  Closing the programme and restarting also had no effect.\n\nThe third problem was that although the 'Page Setup' provided for large margins, these didn't occur and could not be changed on the desktop.\n\nFourth, I could not find a way to increase the screen 'Paper' size. Using ctl and + simply resulted in a '+' character inserted at the cursor. Increasing/decreasing screen paper size is something I do rely on.\n\nFinally I read here that somebody had problems with the application not handling large numbers of pages and crashing. I've not tested that but since I regularly output between 100 and 250 pages, that was a concern.\n\nI realise that this is a very lightweight application with very few frills and fancies. I also realise that the developer may have coded it for a later Ubuntu version rather than the version I'm using - so that may have caused some of problems.\n\nThe interface as is as promised, very clean and uncluttered. It is probably perfectly adequate for the American market as the very positive reviews here prove. Unfortunately, it is of no use to me and I will have to continue using 'Only Office'.\n\nI would guess that many people, including the developer would say to me that I should stick with a proper word processor. I can accept that. I just wanted to give Focus Writer a chance.\n\nIf somebody subsequently can point me to a button or something that I've missed where all or most of the above problems are solved I will very happily change my review. I don't like to, and I very rarely leave a bad review, especially if lots of people are giving good reviews.  I often accept that the problem is either me - or my computer!\n\nThanks for reading this far.\n\nThisisi", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 509372, "score": 10, "summary": "Lots of little problems that add up to a big NO!", "user_display": "This Is I", "version": "1.6.12"}, {"app_id": "focuswriter.desktop", "date_created": 1464793606.0, "description": "FocusWriter's power lies under the hood.
