That is about where the good things stop though. Really this seems to have just taken the artboard, rectangle, and circle tool out of Inkscape and made them their own app for no apparent reason. Really it has basically no features, and on top of that it is really buggy. You cannot even select multiple objects at once to perform basic boolean operations, even though they are meant to be usable. It would be nice to see some standard artboard sizes based on phones/tablets or something like that also. I guess I am not really sure why this program exists unless it was like an undergrad's thesis project or something, because really it does nothing you can't do easier in Inkscape.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 19, "karma_up": 30, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 185148, "score": 17, "summary": "A stripped down version of Inkscape", "user_display": "James", "version": "master"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.akira-xxNkF4jlau06Kz2kgeYhWNDU0r4tWJeM", "date_created": 1587866693.0, "description": "Happy to see it's released.
