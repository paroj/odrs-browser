It remains a favorite to this day.\n\nThanks to the programmers of this game, I can relive one of my favorite sequences from that virtual reality; the Light Cycles. This has been done very well. I know - what an understatement, here.\n\nEven for people who are just looking for some neat fast-action game play with no real interest in 80s nostalgia, you've still come to the right place.
