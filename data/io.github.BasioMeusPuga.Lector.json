Acceptable integration with GNOME.\nThe Bad: everything else. Scrolling with the mouse is a nightmare. Trying to \"grab\" the scrollbar on the right just flips the page to the next one. It forces you to use the scroll wheel which, for long pages, is obnoxiously slow.\nOne time, while rapidly skimming through the pages of a book, it somehow ended up with an invalid page number and the program just froze. What was worse, it saved that page number and I couldn't return to a regular page. It simply showed me nothing and no way to return to the normal view. Even closing the program and re-opening the book wouldn't work as it \"saved\" its position to the invalid page number. I had to change the filename just so that I could start from scratch. That's not good.\nFinally, the search function just doesn't work. I was reading a cryptobook and I searched for the string \"RSA\" in it. Guess what? It didn't find any occurrence for that. Then I switched to Lector (a different ebook reader), searched for the exact same string, got back over 20 results. Seriously, this program very badly needs bug fixing.\nOnly reason I still use it is for viewing manga, which it is decent at", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 335492, "score": 0, "summary": "Mediocre", "user_display": "alex", "version": "0.5.1"}, {"app_id": "io.github.BasioMeusPuga.Lector", "date_created": 1613698268.0, "description": "I love how light and responsive this app is... it does what I need for ebook collection management and metadata editing - while being super lightweight: responsive, fast and doesn't pull loads of dependencies ", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 342694, "score": 0, "summary": "Light and does the job well", "user_display": "Joel Cornuz", "version": "0.5.1"}, {"app_id": "io.github.BasioMeusPuga.Lector", "date_created": 1627262615.0, "description": "simple and intuitive", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 402777, "score": 0, "summary": "prety nice", "user_display": "jefer", "version": "0.5.1"}, {"app_id": "io.github.BasioMeusPuga.Lector", "date_created": 1642291391.0, "description": "Unable to launch.
