[{"app_id": "openra-d2k.desktop", "date_created": 1525249669.0, "description": "OpenRA is my favourite Linux RTS game, 0 A.D. is a close second, but I find OpenRA simpler and more fun. It is one of closest Linux-compatible games I've found to my favourite PC game, Outlive. Outlive is more futuristic, however, but still they are somewhat similar. \n\nThe only major limitation is that you cannot set the difficulty of the AI (i.e. your opponent in single-player mode), you just have a choice of four AIs. The default AI (Rush AI) is fairly ease to fight and never seems to use aircraft, while Normal AI uses aircraft quite frequently, but is still pretty ease to beat. I wish I could make the AI more of a challenge to fight.", "distro": "openSUSE Tumbleweed", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 1, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 7473, "score": 0, "summary": "Best semi-modern RTS game available for Linux", "user_display": "Brenton Horne", "version": "20180307"}, {"app_id": "net.openra.OpenRA", "date_created": 1552669732.0, "description": "This is the finest free 2/2.5D RTS game there is for Linux IMO. 0 A.D. is the only rival it has for the title of best free RTS game for Linux. It has several different mods, with the main ones being remakes of early Westwood games and it is easy to obtain on virtually any Linux distro, partly because it is available in a number of distribution-agnostic package formats like: AppImage, Flatpak and Snap. \n\nDespite my general love of this game it is definitely not without its shortcomings. For example, there are some features missing from it -- like you cannot save a game and play it later, nor can you set the difficulty of the AI you're playing against (although you can choose from a few different AIs, but they differ more in strategy than difficulty). Likewise, it has some performance issues on larger maps and the game sometimes freezes when enough units are moving at once.", "distro": "Arch Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 1, "locale": "en_AU", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 17246, "score": 0, "summary": "Best free 2/2.5D RTS game available for Linux", "user_display": null, "version": "release"}, {"app_id": "net.openra.OpenRA", "date_created": 1612236362.0, "description": "Nice work.
