I've taken pretty much every GTK-based Twitter and Mastodon app for a spin, and can say without reservation that Tuba is my favorite so far.\n\nIf I had to boil down my reasons for why the experience is so lovely, I would mark it down to these 4 things:\n\n1. The built-in media viewer is unabtrusive, clever, and slick. Tapping or clicking an image makes it appear full-screen, and it's easy to jump back to the content when you're done. It also handles slideshows well.\n\n2. It makes use of libadwaita's adaptive stylings really well. It goes from a pure list/stream of content, to an expanded view complete with sidepanes, and reasonable margins to fit ever-expanding window sizes. \n\n3. It provides settings for larger font sizes and line heights to make the reading experience more pleasant, but it doesn't weigh you down with endless sets of buttons or text fields to tweak every single variable. \n\n4. It features all the core Mastodon experiences (including local and federated timelines) in a way that doesn't feel like an afterthought.\n\nAll in all, I'm quite impressed, and look forward to seeing more updates appear, because I know they'll bring quality as well.
