So awesome. I finally feel ungimped. Whoever people who made this, you are truly magnificent people. I finally started using it today, and felt let I was using stuff I already knew from Unity and Unreal. It\u2019s a massive relief on the brain not to have to keep translating from one system to the next. I know these software seem like a dime a dozen, but this one serves a very great purpose for people who have accustomed to certain patterns and then having extreme difficulty transferring momentarily to another.
