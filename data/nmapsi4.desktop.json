During the first time through this process the app crashed. I looked at the log and manually updated all packages that the crash report said were outdated and it does not seem to crash anymore. When I specify the ip range with addresses, it seems to return just the active hosts. yea! I could not use fingerprinting (-O) without dropping to the console and running it with sudo so if you are wanting to id the OS and you have to run the terminal anyway, you might as well just send nmap to a txt file with \"sudo nmap -sT -O [range] > nmap-results.txt\" then gedit nmap-results.txt or something like that.
