The concept of full and partial backups was always something I didn't feel represented how I use my data.\n\nThen came CrashPlan, and backup was easy, seamless - you just ran it and you can go back to any point in time and grab a copy of your file if you f'd up. It was a fire-and-forget freedom that saved me a few times.\n\nOnce CrashPlan stopped servicing personal computers, I had to find an alternative and researched the open source apps until I landed on restic.\nRestic implements the same ability to go back in time to a time of your choosing and pick whatever existed at that time. It is also somewhat similar in concept to a git repository (commit --> snapshot) in the sense that it uploads only your changes (like a partial backup) but when you return to that snapshot you get a full view of your back-up material, that looks and feels like you took a full backup at the time.\n\nAdd nifty features like mounting the backup repository in my home directory so I can select exactly what I want, granularly decide what I don't want backed up, bandwidth limits and multiple host backup to the same repository and it's just what I wanted all along.\n\nIt is a command line tool, with no GUI I know of yet, so don't expect double-click to heaven. It is worth investing in learning it and setting it up, because when you're in a tough spot it will save you.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_AU.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 200214, "score": 0, "summary": "Backups done right", "user_display": "IT", "version": "0.9.6"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.restic-HptL9k7u5SIpXLY9pZo29FtYizhdlz4H", "date_created": 1591977143.0, "description": "No GUI = USELESS.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 229174, "score": 0, "summary": "Useless", "user_display": "Tim Nichols", "version": "0.9.6"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.restic-HptL9k7u5SIpXLY9pZo29FtYizhdlz4H", "date_created": 1598552158.0, "description": "Negative reviewers expecting some GUI backup app are ridiculous.
