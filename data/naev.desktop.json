I'd recommend that over Naev since it is more fully-featured. Still, Naev has some interesting changes to the basic Escape Velocity formula, such as a more detailed simulation model.

But it got boring in parts because there was little going on but moving between planets. Only after playing for 2 days - seemed like 2 years - did I get to interesting missions and then they were impossible to pass. Ships shooting from out of range of your weapons so you cant hit back. There was also a mission for an engine test, of course, the engine failed, but really! Did the whole game have to slow to a crawl, and have to fight literally 100's of enemies over a 2 hours space? That's not playability, that repetitive boring BS. If I could sue the authors for my time I would, don't waste yours playing this. Pick an alternative, any alternative.
