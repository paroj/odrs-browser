What's the point? Most of the apps are severely lacking compared to their web equivalent (ebay, amazon, twitter, faceboak etc.) so why ditch the web page in favour of less functionality and more storage space needs on your device? It beats me. (Even windoze 11 has reduced functionality compared to windoze 10 - they want more control over what we can see ;-)\n\nI think that 3 stars is generous for this app since it actually does provice all the channels provided but it's a pain to get at. You must open a teminal and type a command or setup a desktop shortcut somehow, which the installation procedure should really do for you, in order to load the program into memory and run it - quite old-fashioned. It also doesn't show the history of the playlist on the current channel, which the web page does.\n\nOh well, life goes on ...", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 480428, "score": 0, "summary": "Poor replacement for the web page", "user_display": "Malcolm McLean", "version": "master"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.somafm-qt-EYpaNBd9gOYxTppVeDKPL0KxkMfbcCRk", "date_created": 1591958602.0, "description": "keine Reaktion unter Un 20.04 lts.,wird noch nicht einmal in den Aktivit\u00e4ten aufgef\u00fchrt!", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "de_DE.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 229030, "score": 0, "summary": "sagt weder Muh noch M\u00e4h", "user_display": "Luzifer", "version": "master"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.somafm-qt-EYpaNBd9gOYxTppVeDKPL0KxkMfbcCRk", "date_created": 1668476738.0, "description": "\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u0421\u0430\u043d-\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e SomaFm", "distro": "Peppermint", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "ru_RU.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 538970, "score": 31, "summary": "\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435!", "user_display": "Alexander Cheban", "version": "master"}]
