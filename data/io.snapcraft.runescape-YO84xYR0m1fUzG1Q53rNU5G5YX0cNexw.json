When it wouldn't start after being installed with Discover, I was confused. I went and tried to install RSU manually and that did not work as well. Out of sheer desperation I installed the Snap Store (snap install snap-store) and found that when I installed that one that it worked (although it was listed as OS Runescape Launcher without a proper icon).\n\nThen, to post a review of this version on Discover I had to reinstall the version that I had from discover since I had already uninstalled it before installing the Snap Store version. Upon reinstalling this version provided by Discover I found that this version suddenly worked. Now what I don't know is whether this Discover version worked because I reinstalled it or if it works only because I had installed the Snap Store one. I don't think these osrs clients are the same because the one from the snap store does not come with a launcher/updater interface whereas this one does.\n\nThe Discover version of Old School Runescape is the RSU-Launcher version which allows you to use which prm you want to play. I use oldschool.prm, which I was able to select next to the refresh news button.\n\nThe Snap Store version I had installed before reinstalling the Discover version. I launched it just before I had reinstalled the Discover version and found that it worked at least as far as the main menu screen. In order to be able to post a review of the version from Discover I had to reinstall the Discover version. When I did that, I found that it was suddenly working. I played a bit of that version. After testing that version I decided to continue playing the snap store version. Both versions seem to work. I don't know what the heck happened. \n\nMaybe the Snap Store version installed a dependency that the Discover version needed in order to run? Both of them work fine now!\n\nAnyway, if you want my opinion on the game itself, it is great. Fantastic. It works pretty well on old computers, too. I have a computer from 2006 -- a ThinkPad T60 with a Core2Duo T7200 running Lubuntu 18.04 Linux -- that ran it nicely.
