The program downloaded and launched without any hesitation. \n\nFirst, I selected a video on my computer with an .srt file (Subtitles) and loaded the srt. The program then asked for the appropriate video file - which I then selected.\n\nIn an instant I could play the clips relating to each subtitle. Editing each clip was easy and 'Saving' happened in an instant. (You have to select the icons - I didn't see any text for 'Load' and 'Save'.)\n\nI then loaded a video that did not have subtitles. I had to select the 'MP4' type in order to \"see\" the video for loading. As before, the video loaded in an instant.\n\nBy selecting \"Add\" I created a subtitle text box and typed in the opening spoken lines. The audio waveform is shown on the Timeline at the bottom of the video screen which makes synchronising the start of each subtitle almost \"Lip-Sync\". Dragging the subtitle box on the time line enables precise positioning and also the duration of each subtitle. It is also easy to keep replaying each clip in order to get the exact spoken words.\n\n'Add' creates then next subtitle text box - etc etc.\n\nAfter creating several minutes of subtitles, I saved the subtitle file in the same folder as the video file. (This is essential) The name of the file MUST also be identical to the video file in order for the subs to be recognised.\n\nI then opened the video with VLC and started it playing. I selected the subtitle track from the menu. Sure enough, the subtitles appeared, in sync to the video. Just PERFECT!!\n\nOut of interest, I opened the new .srt file in a text editor. The subtitles simply appear as normal, standard subs. (as expected).\n\nThis really is a great program. It does what it says it does, and is simplicity to operate to produce professional looking subtitles.\n\nI have a few short videos which are not in English. I can now use this program to provide English translation subtitles. Thank you to the software developer for making this very useful program freely available.\n\nIf this software won't open or work on your computer, that is YOUR problem! This software works correctly! Just accept that the fault lies with YOUR computer's configuration or your lack of knowledge. Deal with it. Get over it, and don't keep blaming the software. Doing that, just makes you look stupid!\n\nAny comments appearing below this one, and stating \"It doesn't work\" etc etc, will prove that those people are too lazy to even bother to check other comments and just assume that everything else is always wrong - except THEMSELVES!\n \nThanks for reading this far\n\nThisisi.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 253966, "score": 0, "summary": "Brilliant.

I *can* make .srt subtitles for .mp4 video and have used this program successfully. If handled with proper caution you'll get where you want to get.

I hope Canonical fix that some day.\n\nI really appreciate constructive criticism and really want to improve the software. My tests can not be as wide as the user's. If you read carefully the description, there are various ways to report bugs and even contacting me in a personal way. You can use the issue track (https://gitlab.com/jonata/subtitld), you can use Twitter (https://twitter.com/subtitld), you can join our Discord (https://discord.gg/dpkEGrE), you can email me (subtitld@jonata.org). I really want to help you to use the software.\n\nAlso, the bad reviews here point to bugs that were already fixed some time ago. So please, make sure you are using the latest version, make sure that your Subtitld is updated with the latest released version. You can even install the beta channel with the latest code to check.\n\nAgain, please, don't hesitate in contacting me.
