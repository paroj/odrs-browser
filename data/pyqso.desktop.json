Not very organised!\n\nSo I decided to drag myself into the 'modern' age by sourcing a computerised log book and this one seemed just the ticket. \n\nEasy install in Linux, (Ubuntu 20.04), and very straight forward to use. Seems to have everything I need and more! Will be useful in keeping details of other operators for my VHF/UHF useage and even abilities for any HF activities I may use. I'm not a 'competition' operator or call sign chaser but this does seem like it could handle that too.\n\nOverall, very pleased. Big thumbs up from me and thank you for an excellent piece of software.\n\nM7VIC", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 420446, "score": 0, "summary": "Great Logbook", "user_display": "Victor", "version": "1.1.0"}]
