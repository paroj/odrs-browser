They don want to have to relearn how to use a pdf editor. I have worked with adobe and Nuance pdf software and know there are standard, easier ways to create pdf documents.

Imagine that, cutting a good section of your work space for an \u201cObject Inspector\u201d instead of allowing in place editing. Funny, they claim a banner to workflow. \u00b4It\u015b a pity that just about all heavy lifting applications for Linux actually come from outside Linux, but that\u015b the way it is. One work around for those that find working with Master PDF a chore is to use the following option: if you at least have the following (unofficial) suite of productive apps installed: Libre Office, Xournal++, Okular, you will have much more to do and probably in a much easier manner.\n\nMaster PDF has many features, many are annoying such as the workflow busting restarts every time you make adjustments within the application. The mark and claim to a superior PDF editor is the functionality of its OCR engine weather it be traditional or AI.\n\nMaster PDF fails the test here. It certainly does not use\na good engine because it feels like it\u015b using a genetic, vanilla-flavored, Linux type of engine. Its why it produces poor results.\nThe rest of Master PDF is just imitation of functionalities existing in other PDF editors carried out in a harder way. So, don't expect anything unique in its usability. Expect buggy performance under Linux usage.
