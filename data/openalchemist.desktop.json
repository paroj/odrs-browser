That part I get.\n\nBut then, later on, strange blocks -- penguins, cherries -- are added in without explanation. And sometimes these transform into other blocks. And it's hard to tell how high I can stack my blocks before I lose the game. And as for the description that claims that the game incorporates chemistry, I've yet to see that... I think?\n\nThe developers should either simplify the gameplay some, or include an in-game tutorial. All that said, this game has a modern look and feel and is quite easy to jump right into, even if it's not clear what's going on.\n\nAmoebax is a more comprehensible puzzler with very similar gameplay.
