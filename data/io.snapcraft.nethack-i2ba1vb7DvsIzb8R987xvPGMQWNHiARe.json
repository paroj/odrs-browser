Without Nethack and other games like it the modern cRPG would probably look entirely different. What story there is is excellent and when you use your imagination from the command line it is an easy world to get lost in. Do not play this in a terminal window. Play it on a full screen console by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F key starting at 1 and going until you get a text mode login. For me it's F3. It is worth the time to figure out how to play this game.
