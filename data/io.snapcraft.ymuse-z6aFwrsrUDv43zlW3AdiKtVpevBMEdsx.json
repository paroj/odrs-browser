This is exactly what i have been searching for. However there seems to be one small problem with the playback but i think you can fix it very easy. The problem is that the next song in the playlist is not played automatically after the previous song ends. Both enabling and disabling of consume do not solve the issue. In order to play the next song i need to click the play button, click the next song button or click on the next song in the playlist.
