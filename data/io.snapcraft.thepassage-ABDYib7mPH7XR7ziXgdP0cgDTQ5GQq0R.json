It is entirely playable and looks like something you'd pay $5-10 for on Steam. There are a few minor graphical glitches here and there that become more aparent as you gain the dash ability later in the game. Still overall a very polished game by freebie standards. However, I cannot defeat the boss on the final level. After hacking it's security system, the boss loses about 30% health and just freezes there.
