It took me about 4 - 5 minutes to get used to the controls (I used a mouse) but then realized that it's just the blue dot that's \"new/4D\" and once that penny dropped, I was knocking out targets pretty quickly. The 4D element is actually quite clever and gives the player that when in space, it's not just about up, down, left and right that a pilot has to think about, it's that 4D element (think of it like a power or visual contrast element). Leads me to question: will there be a 5th element coming we wonder (right click and up/down)??!!\n\nI like the fact that the targets aren't ships, aliens or anything like that - they're seemingly \"milky ways\" (which of course, could mean that aliens are being destroyed) but it's unusual for targets to be benign.\n\nReally lovely graphics and atmospherics.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 365238, "score": 0, "summary": "Interesting addition to basic point and shoot", "user_display": "dave", "version": "1.2.5.dfsg.1"}, {"app_id": "adanaxisgpl.desktop", "date_created": 1640562118.0, "description": "Manche Missionen sind etwas schwer, aber Spiel und Hintergrundmusik gefallen mir", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "de_DE.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 449876, "score": 0, "summary": "coole Idee", "user_display": "a", "version": "1.2.5.dfsg.1"}, {"app_id": "adanaxisgpl.desktop", "date_created": 1644348574.0, "description": "no le dalagana de cargar", "distro": "Debian GNU/Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "es_VE", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 461648, "score": 0, "summary": "no carga", "user_display": "ali", "version": "1.2.5.dfsg.1"}]
