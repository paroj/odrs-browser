SE works well, does what says on the box, and is a joy to work with. It's stable (even on Ubuntu 18.04) and reviews complaining about it being outdated are... well, outdated.\n\nMy only criticism (which is why I'm giving it only four stars) is that the UI has some flaws. Some UI text is extremely small (sometimes impossible to read) and does not respond to font adjustments in the preferences. On some buttons the labels are missing completely.\n\nOh, and it's only available as a snap package, which I hate for reasons of performance and the inability to access the parts of my file system where I keep my data, but that's a snap issue and not related to SE.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 622902, "score": 24, "summary": "Excellent, except for a few UI issues", "user_display": "Frank van Wensveen", "version": "3.5.13.192"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.subtitle-edit-gDy1P9pYLhDPxvLOv51wI9AZ06Smn5N2", "date_created": 1584121110.0, "description": "Interface is strange and not responsible. the file system navigation has a lot of bugs and the app keep closing and stopping work properly.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 2, "karma_up": 2, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 40, "reported": 1, "review_id": 163858, "score": 0, "summary": "Terrible Interface, lots of bugs", "user_display": "Rafael Holanda", "version": "3.5.13.192"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.subtitle-edit-gDy1P9pYLhDPxvLOv51wI9AZ06Smn5N2", "date_created": 1590421777.0, "description": "I had an srt file that had errors and gaupol would crash every time tried to edit the text.
