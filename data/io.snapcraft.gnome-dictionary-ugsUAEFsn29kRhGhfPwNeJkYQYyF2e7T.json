My desktop publishers/word processors each have spelling checkers, but they don't also give the meanings to enable me ensure that I'm using the correct word.\n\nI first read all the reviews regarding this application. Despite the majority of people stating \"It Doesn't Work\". A few users said it did work so I went ahead and installed it.\n\nThe first time I ran the application I was presented with a message to the effect -\"Default Dictionary not Found\". This was not a good start!\n\nI pressed the accompanying \"Ok\" button and was presented with a blank white square with no text but a few 'hieroglyphs'. Again hardly useful to a new user with NOTHING to suggest appropriate action. \n\nI started clicking on the hieroglyphs and managed to call up a box which suggest that here was where a particular dictionary would be named. Still nothing to prompt or guide me. \n\nFurther clicking on the hieroglyphs then suddenly called up an impressive list of dictionaries. \n\nOk. Lets Copy & Paste a dictionary name. No! Copy & Paste do not work! \nAfter further random clicking I suddenly found that a dictionary HAD now transferred to the appropriate box. \n\nI tested the dictionary with several words and sure enough - it worked very well.\n\nBearing in mind previous comments of others regarding spellings, I then tried with a word deliberately misspelled by just one letter! I was greeted with \"Error - No definition found for ~~~\".!!\n\nDictionaries are predominantly used for the checking the correct spelling of a particular word. Checking the actual meaning of a word is used by most people somewhat less than the checking the spelling.\n\nThis dictionary, although having a very good concept is appallingly coded by somebody of the opinion \"If I know how it works then everybody else will know as well.\" The many reviews here speak for themselves. The application is certainly NOT intuitive to use and many others have given up and uninstalled it.\n\nFinding and selecting \"Help\" simply points the user to the 'Gnome Help', apparently for using Ubuntu, not the dictionary. Again, this indicates careless and sloppy code writing.\n\nAs somebody who now does a lot of writing and needs to check the spellings of similar sounding words with different meanings, I cannot advise the use of this application. \n\nHowever, if you are simply reading literature, you already have the correct spelling and are looking up a meaning of a word it will probably be acceptable for you.\n\nBe prepared to click in the most unlikely places to get a result. Although the concept is good this is a very poorly coded application.\n\nThanks for reading this far.\n\nThisisi.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 534161, "score": 0, "summary": "I don't like it!.
