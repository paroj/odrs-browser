A couple nitpicks:\n\n1. It would be nice if when you hit play again that it just started another puzzle, rather than taking you back to the initial screen of the app.\n\n2. The words are...very strange. Much more obscure than in Wordle. I don't really mind because I like the challenge, and learning new words. Someone who really wanted a perfect clone of Wordle may not enjoy that aspect though.\n\n3. A play history would be nice...just the ability to see what words you've done. Maybe even to see your guesses for previous words?
