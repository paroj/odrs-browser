Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. I couldn't get any sound or functionality out of it. The manual is totally unhelpful, poorly written, and doesn't answer any basic questions. The manual is in fact as useless as the program. There is no help to be found ANYWHERE, unless you feel like getting on an automated mailing list and hoping that somehow they will mail you exactly what you need. I searched for hours on the net looking for answers, and I am still stunned at the lack of helpful information.
