It works fine, but probably not as useful as you might think.\nUsually you have to get FS-UAE and FS-UAE launcher if you want to keep your sanity and use multiple configurations.\n\nNow, FS-UAE is probably on your repositories already, so not that big of a deal having it as a FlatPack.\nFS-UAE is usually also on the repositores, but not as FlatPack. If you run any minimally bleeding edge distro, this package is infamous for updating really slowly and using out of date python versions, probably you need to go trough lots of headaches to keep it working (and it will stop working eventually for months till they update).\n\nSo, cool having FS-UAE.
