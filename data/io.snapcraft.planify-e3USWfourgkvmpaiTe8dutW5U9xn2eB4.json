It really made you feel more productive, but there is an issue I just encountered. I tried to drag the \"plus button\" and now I couldn't add task anymore. Also, when you try to add new column on grid mode (kanban mode) there will be another column named \"No Section\" even though you did not create it, and also that column's name is uneditable.\n\nAnyways, it is good. I like how you designed it, and the animation and all. So please let me know once you have fixed the issues so that I can continue using it.
