Just by adding some of the GUI features you have thought of, which other people didn't and couldn't think of, you made an originally very dull Vim application(at least dull for us beginners) something very different. Now it's appropriate for both the new-users and old ones. \r\nVim IS POWERFUL, but for a new comer is like piece of rubbish because you can't use it as soon as you got it, you have to remember a lots of regulations and instructions. Simply for the goal of being a complete 'no GUI ' editor, it lost something, with which it could have been a LOT more fun, interesting and inspiring. But you did it. You made it fun again, an amazing editor just what I want.
