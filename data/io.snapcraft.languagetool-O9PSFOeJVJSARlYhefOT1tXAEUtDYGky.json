I have to cut the sentence within the bracket and paste it outside the brackets before I'm able to remove the phantom brackets.\n\nTo avoid this oddity, I'll have to bypass using the copy and paste process and just type the sentence into the app. That's not a deal breaker, it just seems odd to me that it happens. I plan to use this app with a different Writer program that I like to use (AbiWord) to see if the phantom brackets show up there as well.\n\nThank you for providing this app. I really appreciate that I don't have to use an online grammar checker that constantly invites me to utilize more of their products than I actually need.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 606357, "score": 0, "summary": "Works for me", "user_display": "Mo", "version": "6.3"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.languagetool-O9PSFOeJVJSARlYhefOT1tXAEUtDYGky", "date_created": 1620079636.0, "description": "Lo prob\u00e9 una vez y funcion\u00f3, seguir\u00e9 probando.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "es_AR", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 372633, "score": 0, "summary": "Lo prob\u00e9 una vez y funcion\u00f3, seguir\u00e9 probando", "user_display": "Gonzalo", "version": "5.4"}]
