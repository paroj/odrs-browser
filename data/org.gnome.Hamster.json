[{"app_id": "org.gnome.Hamster", "date_created": 1675411418.0, "description": "Hamster is powerful enough for serious time tracking. It can be mostly used with keyboard. It understands that the day may end long past midnight. Reports show you useful summaries, although they could use more filtering options. Correcting past records mostly works, but it could use some more intelligence and undo function. Backup is a bit awkward as the database file is hidden in weird location, especially in flatpak version.\n\nFlatpak version has a bug that prevents Hamster from starting. Workaround can be found on the internet (search for flatpak hamster desktop DBusActivatable).", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 4, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 560994, "score": 21, "summary": "Powerful and efficient if you get it to work", "user_display": "Robert Va\u017ean", "version": "3.0.2"}, {"app_id": "org.gnome.Hamster", "date_created": 1688466011.0, "description": "Needs a way to remind users to enter time.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 595572, "score": 0, "summary": "Needs reminder feature", "user_display": "Greg Baker", "version": "3.0.2"}, {"app_id": "org.gnome.Hamster", "date_created": 1689753851.0, "description": "Installed it from flathub and it just doesn't do anything", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "de_DE.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 596842, "score": 0, "summary": "Does not start", "user_display": "Noah Gro\u00df", "version": "3.0.2"}]
