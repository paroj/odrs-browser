I actually do think this game could turn out to be a successful MMORPG down the road. The New Player experience could really use some work as new players won't know what they're supposed to do. I haven't fully explored all of the current game content but even I started off with just running around before understanding I needed to craft things to get better gear. Like most RPGs, I'm used to having some kind of objective to follow so this was that one change that threw me off just a little. But I guess I'll continue referring to the game's online manual which also could use more work.\n\nThe Airshipper launcher for Veloren is alright, but under Wayland and especially as a Flatpak carries a lot of issues. The native Wayland port for Airshipper introduces a non-native window decoration and sometimes crashes when changing the launch settings. In Veloren, the native Wayland port has weird mouse issues and it doesn't stay locked in the game. And since I currently use the Flatpak version, the example command given for fetching server latency doesn't work at all. But I still manually pinged each server outside of the launcher and found which one I needed to play on.\n\nAll issues aside, I still keep coming back to the game. I even stream the game once in a while.
