With pver 200 fonts, you can imagine the time that takes, and I have 3 physical PCs running Ubuntu plus one Virtual Machine on my MacBook Pro. The job was insane.

One note: After importing the fonts, I still had some issues with font matching. When I opened the app and looked, I saw that all fonts were installed, but not all were active. So be sure to activate the fonts, after you import them. I have had no problems using this with TTF fonts.
