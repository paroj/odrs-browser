Yet, crashes a lot on Fedora 35 Wayland as one other user stated. And I don't know why but a Bash script didn't run when I wrote it in Spyder, saying there was a syntax error even though there wasn't but worked well by just copy/paste with Atom. Maybe my mistake or my configuration, yet it's still weird. I tried and used the Windows version and it was great there. Maybe better to use with other Linux distros apart from Fedora Wayland.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 477971, "score": 0, "summary": "would recommend but with Fedora some issues", "user_display": null, "version": "5.1.5"}]
