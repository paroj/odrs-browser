At first, in my office computer, the app worked properly (this was in 19/07/2016). But on the next day, I don't know what happened, it started to crash when I tried to configure the axis to log-log scale and change the export format to gnuplot. However, the worst is when the app doesn't crashes in these circumstances, because I continue to working, giving point to point in three different curves, digitizing each one, and saving... But when I export the data, the exported file is empty!!! So I decided to test it in my home computer, and the same is happening, and this time it crashed at the first attempt to use it. Does anyone know what's happening?
