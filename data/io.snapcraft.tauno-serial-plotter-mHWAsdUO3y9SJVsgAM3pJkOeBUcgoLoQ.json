You can't chose what gets plotted or labels or the style that the data is plotted in. If you have lots of channels of data comming in and are looking for a program to selectively plot only portions of it at a time, this will not do that. I don't even think you can set the limits, but I'm not sure. Might as well just use the arduino serial plotter.
