I am paraphrasing an old Arabian proverb that is not from the Bible. So then, why put it there? Because while I am a Christian, and a student of the Bible, I would myself be a fool to claim that there is no need of any instruction that is not specifically in the Bible. Yeah, it is a great book to live by and you can learn a ton from it. But not everything. Not even close. Indeed, I can type about 85 wpm and never found this in the Bible.  But for those who spout about the Bible being fiction yet call people in the Bible baby-killers and slave-owners. If it's fiction, what is the problem? It never happened. Are those things a good idea? NO! But not everyone in the Bible is lumped into one group; no good no evil just that group. And yet I am the fool? Also, please stop SAYING that there are errors and contradictions! I have carried a Bible around and read it in my own time and not in everyone's plain sight. But people walking by (as one type of example) will come at me all angry and had people start saying these things and every single time when I ask, \"Please, show me. I did not know that and I would certainly like to know.\" Nobody can, and nobody will find errors. Okay, Think: over more than 20 centuries, there have been very many minds sharper that yours or mine who have combed through this Bible trying to find something--ANYthing!--don't you think that it would have hit NATIONAL news, headlines, etc.? Somebody finally found one! No. You would think that in a span of time close to 4,000 years, 66 \"Books\" (scrolls, codices and eventually books) but okay 66 Books, and by at least 35 some think closer to 40 but either way, 35-40 different authors. And there is not one discrepancy? I will be the first to admit: such odds are outright impossible...if not for God's Divine inspiration But really: would you want a god who you could completely figure out as in nothing a mystery or wonder. NO! Think for yourselves; find your own answers! Think: Non-life cannot become life. Ever. The probability according to Dr. Bradley and Dr. Thaxton calculated the probability of amino acids \"Naturally\" forming into a protein as 4.9 x 10^-191 chance. Since anything below a number to the negative 50th power is essentially Zero, I would say, think for yourself. Go to genesisapologetics.com or icr.org to check it out for yourself. I think you will learn a lot whether you ever become a Christian. They are not mutually exclusive. The universe could not always have been because all the stars would be burned out since nobody has ever witnessed a star being born. The closest possible is a wolf rayett (sp?) brown dwarf...and even then, no. But nebulae are explosion remnants. Gases like to naturally disperse, not glue together. And for something to have created itself it would have to both exist to create it and not exist to be created! Think, my friends!
