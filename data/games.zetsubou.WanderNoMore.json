[{"app_id": "games.zetsubou.WanderNoMore", "date_created": 1694749350.0, "description": "Playing Wander No More was an enjoyable experience for me overall. The game doesn't require any player interactions at all, so it truly is a visual novel at its core. \n\nIt's such a shame that the game is really short, as I enjoyed the interactions between Kou and Chiyo, and I would like to explore more about their daily lives before and after the events in the story.\n\nAside from the story, the visual design and the music were also pretty good, especially for a small and free indie game of this size. Personally, I think that there should be more ambient noise and other sound effects playing in the background of the conversations to make the game world's more lively. \n\nAs for the voice acting, I think it is a bit hit or miss. While the voice actors for Kou and Chiyo were both superb, I can't really say the same for the voices of other supporting characters, though that's just my personal opinion.\n\nOverall, should you have the time, I would highly recommend trying out Wander No More.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 601603, "score": 0, "summary": "An Enjoyable Visual Novel", "user_display": "SenoToki", "version": "1.2"}, {"app_id": "games.zetsubou.WanderNoMore", "date_created": 1676482141.0, "description": "literalmente este juego parece un juego H XDDDD", "distro": "Huayra GNU/Linux", "karma_down": 1, "karma_up": 6, "locale": "es_AR", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 564474, "score": 18, "summary": "parece un juego h XD", "user_display": "Matias Franco", "version": "1.2"}]
