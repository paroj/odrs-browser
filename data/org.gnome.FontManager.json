This 'Font Manager' seemed to fit my requirements. I first read the reviews here and at least three people stated that is was working well for them.\n\nI'm using an almost clean installation of Ubuntu 18.04. I installed the 'Font Manager' in the usual way and then started it. I clicked 'Help' in order to get a feel of how this worked - but this showed a page that said 'Help' was not yet available!\n\nI was able to list the 145 fonts on my system (most of which I do not need).\nClicking them 'unticked' them - and were then listed as 'disabled'. I then opened 'Only Office' and examined the available fonts. They were ALL still there. Okay! I rebooted the PC to see if that did the trick. No, it didn't. \n\nI won't bore you with the many options I tried, but since at least three people stated it worked for them I was extremely puzzled that I could not get it to work. I was sure that it was me not 'doing it right'. \n\nThe website is listed on the download page so I went there to see if I could find any clue as to why I was having no success.\n\n I searched, and searched. Nothing. Finally, I noticed a user reporting a bug where Font Manager had locked his system. Out of curiosity I read further. I was absolutely SHOCKED at the response and brush-off he was give.\nSee for yourselves. https://github.com/FontManager/font-manager/issues/55 \n\nI WILL NOT use any software from somebody who uses such profanity and calls a user a 'troll' because he had a problem, and states software versions offered are 'not his concern'.  The user was extremely polite. The 'Font Manager' coder/maintainer appears extremely 'entitled', pompous and rude.\n\nNeedless to say, although I'd like to know why I could not get Font Manager to work when clearly other users could, It will be uninstalled immediately.\n\nIf you read this far, thanks. \n\nThisisi", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 467811, "score": 0, "summary": "I Need to uninstall this.
