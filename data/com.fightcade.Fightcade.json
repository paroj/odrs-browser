This is a nice and clean install. Not to mention Its very organized and easy to use. Flycast, FBneo, and the other emulators are all working for me. Ive been playing MvC2, Power Stone, Street Fighter Alpha 3 and other random stuff with friends. Every aspect of this app thay Ive used seems to be working as intented.\n\nMy recommendations would be for anyone who downloads this. Is to also get the compainion program \"Wine\" it helps Fightcate run things better. Youll see the program pop up when you type in Fightcade in the Discover store. Secondly, get the most recent Json file for Fightcade. You can google for it. Once you add it, whenever you enter a lobby on Fightcade it will auto download the correct rom for you immediately and place it in the correct directory in the roms folder. You dont have to do anything. It makes Fightcade so mich more convient and premium feeling. As of writing this the most recent Json file is from April 2023. This is a must! No more trying rom after rom. Its just plug n play. Lastly, if you want to play sone of the supported Atomiswave games in the Flycast emulator. Such as Metal Slug 6 or Dolphin Blue for example. You do have to find the Atomiswave bios. i recoomend getting this just so every aspect of Fightcade is available to you. Nice and complete. the Json file will find all those roms for you as well.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this 4 stars out of 5. Is becausse the flatpak version has a issue with creating a new account. When you try to create a new account like I needed to join the community. it will keep saying something about cant connect to the recaptcha and wont complete the account creation process. To get around this I had to download the standard Limux version off the Fightcade website. Then, open the client of that version and create a account. it works fine in that client. After creating my accoiunt that way, I deleted the standard version and successfully logged into this version of Fightcade on my Steam Deck. The accoint creation issue really needs to be addressed and fixed. Other than thay it has been smooth sailing.\n\nI'm really enjoying Fightcade. I'm not sure why the reviews are so low. it definitely is working correctly. Hope this helps somebody! See you on Fightcade!
