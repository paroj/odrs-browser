But my Debian machine did not allow me to go any further than installing snapd. The \"sudo snap\" \"install core\" and \"snap install sharik\" did not work. Then I decided to install the GUI snap. I was then able to install the app on my Debian Linux, but it wouldn't launch at all. Over all a lot of wasted time. I am still just relying on the USB cord to transfer files between my laptop and my android phone. I have even tried FTP and SSH clients - everything that I could get my hands on -; all to no avail. I hope you will fix this problem asap, because there is a real void here. When I had Windows 10 on my machine, I had a file manager on may android that had a very simple and easy to use FTP address that I could enter into my Windows file explorer and get full access to my phone's files. And with Ubuntu, Sharik worked fine, but there is nothing for Debian.
