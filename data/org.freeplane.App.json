But, it's burdened by a painful workflow process and an unintuitive interface.\n\nFor example, when you use it, you will find that you are spending a lot of time adjusting settings and property boxes, etc. This interferes with the flow of ideas capture and ideas set down. One of the central idea of mindmapping is the kinesthetic aspect of creating a mindmap. Modern computer mindmapping software has pretty much removed this important element and it does not need to be replaced by painful workflow. This software introduces too many distractions with too many feature settings for feature sake. It still lacks easy, intutitive visual interface adjustments. I doubt that the developers will be able to revert to a more intuitive tool, but they should realize that the more they expand the software for feature sake, the more they get away from what mindmapping central idea is. Capturing the quick flow of ideas can not be spent adjusting settings in a PC application. I am pretty sure Tony Buzan will agree with that.\n\njm", "distro": "Manjaro Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 479547, "score": 0, "summary": "Mindmapping is freeflow ideas capture", "user_display": "me", "version": "1.8.11 (stable)"}, {"app_id": "org.freeplane.App", "date_created": 1595698504.0, "description": "para realizar mapas mentales", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 8, "karma_up": 4, "locale": "es_MX.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 1, "review_id": 251458, "score": 0, "summary": "buena aplicacion", "user_display": "rosy", "version": "1.8.1"}, {"app_id": "org.freeplane.App", "date_created": 1604478684.0, "description": "Tr\u00e8s efficace, rempli de raccourci clavier, une alternative solide \u00e0 Xmind", "distro": "Arch Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_FR.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 297307, "score": 0, "summary": "Une superbe app de mind mapping", "user_display": null, "version": "1.8.1"}]
