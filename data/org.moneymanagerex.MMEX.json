This is the solution. That is how I used it when I first installed it. All those other buttons/options? Just ignored them. \n\nWant a money manager to help you drill down into your budgetung and assests as well as help with saving for retirement? Works great for that as well. \n\nYes the interface is a bit dated. \n\nHowever not something that bothers me as I care way more how well something works than how good something looks. Plus I do not have to learn a new way of doing things every update like some programs. \n\nAlso there are themes to use or you can design your own. I can not personally say how well that works as it is not something I have ever bothered with.", "distro": "TUXEDO OS", "karma_down": 8, "karma_up": 3, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 595414, "score": 0, "summary": "This is the one you have been waiting for", "user_display": "Richard", "version": "1.6.4"}, {"app_id": "org.moneymanagerex.MMEX", "date_created": 1697388256.0, "description": "Most streamlined open source finance tracker.
