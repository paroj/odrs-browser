I've also designed and produced the inevitable flower pots and vases for the Lady of the House.\n\nI found it fairly easy to learn the basics and produce simple shapes. Then, as I began to learn more complex shapes I found that as I was now recognising the coding structure, I was learning the more complex coding much quicker.\n\nI have found it extremely quick and easy to produce very accurately dimensioned storage boxes of various sizes, and some nesting versions, which allows me to maximise storage of smaller items.i.e. two smaller boxes accurately fitting inside one larger box. This has given me great flexibility for storage, plus when necessary I can create the code for a new sized box in about 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nIt was also quite easy to create boxes with rounded corners to accurately nest inside larger storage trays.\n\nI still find it useful when creating the code, to place annotations at the end of the lines of code in order to remind me the function of that line - just like the 'Rem' function that was used in QuickBasic. In OpenSCad the same effect is achieved using a double forward slash - '//'. \n\nI also use the '//' to place critical dimensions and other info at the top of the code page so I have a quick reference to hand.\n\nBy having 'plain language' at the end of each line makes it very easy to know exactly where to quickly 'tweak' and adjust the design.\n\nOnce the design is completed and Saved, it is then exported to another folder as an STL file. I then use the Prussa Slicer application (also found on Ubuntu) to import the ST file, 'Slice' the design into Gcode, and then Save the Gcode to take to my 3D Printer. (I've described all this in case someone reading it is not yet too familiar with 3D printing but contemplating having a go at designing)\n\nFor the time being, OpenSCad does all I require of a design application for 3D printing. If I was to look at a far more complex design, I suspect this application may struggle with extensive code, so I have given 4 stars out of 5.\n\nThanks for reading this far.
