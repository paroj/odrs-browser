Just reload the page when your time is up.\n\nIf you are interested in Shipping, I also watch Marine Traffic :-\nhttps://www.marinetraffic.com\nThis is similar to the aircraft site - it is free for half hour chunks to prevent people using their bandwidth by leaving it open all day. \n\nI hope this brings some entertainment to some of you, to make up for the disappointment trying to use this useless Snap.\n\nThisisi", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 497699, "score": 0, "summary": "Doesn't work - but you can still access the site", "user_display": "ThisisI", "version": "0.0.2"}]
