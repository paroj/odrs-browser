What more could I ask of it? \nFantastic fully encrypted messenger. Even has its own push notifications for phones, so that not even Goog can survey what you're saying or to whom. \nHighly recommend.", "distro": "Debian GNU/Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 1, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 627277, "score": 31, "summary": "Best messenger out there", "user_display": "Brian Cary", "version": "5.8.2"}]
