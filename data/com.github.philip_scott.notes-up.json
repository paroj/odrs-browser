I like the function of placing notebooks within notebooks, as well as the color coding. Being able to search the notebooks has also been a huge plus. In addition, the optional dark themes of the text editor makes writing easier for me.\nOne thing I didn't expect to like was the limited functionality of the text editor (compared to LibreOffice Writer, which was what I previously used for this purpose). It gave me the ability to focus less on my formatting and more on what I was writing. I'd definitely recommend it for things that don't require extreme formatting to make sense.\n(Just something for those of you considering downloading this app for a similar purpose: it doesn't allow you to re-order pages of notes, so they stay where you've created them. I still enjoy using this app though, and it isn't too much of an issue for me.)", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 2, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 14170, "score": 0, "summary": "Excellent and useful!", "user_display": "E.E.Johnson", "version": "1.5.0"}, {"app_id": "com.github.philip_scott.notes-up", "date_created": 1593358191.0, "description": "Can you please integrate google drive so that we don't lose the data?\n\nI have run into many problems with PC.
