[{"app_id": "qtgain.desktop", "date_created": 1596469104.0, "description": "Gave it two stars because it actually runs and is operational, but this is a 0.x beta-quality product. Noteably lacking are menues. Nothing on the main dialogue is clickable, and no man page or info doc is created; one must discover for oneself that alt-clicking (\"right\" clicking) or Ctl-C will bring up a basic menu dialogue. Within that dialogue one may then select the target gain and set the location of your gain tools, but you still can't pick files; you can tell QtGain to open a file dialogue at startup. When you do that you will discover two things: you are not able to select individual files for gain adjustment, only a folder, and when you select that folder QtGain will run ahead without confirmation and begin adjusting the gain for every item in that folder. I suppose when you know how it works it won't tick you off so much, but still: you have to load the software once to set the target gain, then a second time to begin adjusting file gain. It has the feel of a piece of software intended for the author's personal use, not for general distribution. You might just as well do the job from the command line. I'm really not sure how this made it into a main repository. SourceForge says that it hasn't been updated since 2016, there were 12 downloads this week, yet no reviews and no discussion. This is a good initial effort and I encourage the author to pick the project back up and continue development. Things to add: 1) file pick dialogue and the ubiquitous file list manipulation options found in most other software. 2) menu pull-downs. 3) action confirmation. 4) documentation in the form of either a man page, info doc, or preferably both. Getting a program to work and do what it's supposed to is half the job; making it intuitive and/or usable is another half of the job, and the third half of the job is documentation.
