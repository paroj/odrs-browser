Could be downloading for few hours or minuites and will randomly kick in. \nIts been installed via Discover store, so unsure if theres a setting need to change. Definately isnt resolved by moving the app or minimising.\n\n- Prewriting data can timeout 1fichier downloads\nUnsure if still a issue, but for any larger downloads, the program used to premake the file (say a 20gb file) on the drive, then once completed, would start the download.
