Locate the AC process. Mine was labelled vpnui. It will likely have the Cisco symbol by it, if that helps.\n4. Right click it, and press properties. Look for the \"command line\" field to see the it's file location.\n5. In terminal, navigate to the location by using cd. Mine was located under /opt/cisco, which had the subfolders anyconnect and vpn.\n6. In the parent folder (the one right above cisco, so /opt for me), do sudo rm -r cisco/. This command will put you in superuser mode, and recursively remove all files and folders in the directory (deletes everything in /opt/cisco).\n\nPlease make sure you are using to correct folder, and not just copying what I am saying. Confirm uninstall by searching for any connect. It should no longer appear Of course, you COULD use this method for other store apps that present the same problem, but do be careful.
