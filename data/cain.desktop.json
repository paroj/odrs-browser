If you read the description and haven't a clue what the 1st sentence means, and continue to find the entire description had no discernible meaning, still give it a go, and find when you try to open something, there's a directory called \"examples\" in there, where you can find a few example models... but .. then, what...? can't double-click one of them or don't think of trying, conclude there are no models and complain about that in your \"review\"..? Or was it that (didn't check) the models I tried were in Cain format, so you could just \"open\" them, but you wanted ones that you had to select \"import\" instead of \"open\"?\nThis may well be an educational tool, I have little idea. One probably needs to have a good idea what the description means, at least - to determine that.. which I don't. But don't blame the software because you have no clue what it is or does. It looks like it does stuff like it says, but I didn't like chemistry enough to take enough of it to get to a point where this stuff has more than a mere hint of meaning.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 256075, "score": 0, "summary": "Looks ok, probably does what it says it does", "user_display": "Andrew", "version": "1.10"}, {"app_id": "cain.desktop", "date_created": 1488731746.0, "description": "\u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0442 \n", "distro": "Kali GNU/Linux", "karma_down": 2, "karma_up": 3, "locale": "ru_RU", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 2312, "score": 0, "summary": "\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0435 ", "user_display": null, "version": "unknown"}]
