It really is as simple as that. The interface uses just two buttons - one to Load the PDF - the other to create the image.\n\nFirst, I used \"Krop\" (from Ubuntu) to select the various required portions of text on the PDF's I needed reduce in volume. \nKrop is non destructive and 'Saves' the cropped file as a separate PDF with a \"Cropped\" suffix added - so the original PDF remains unaltered.\nKrop also has Batch settings which can really speed up the process.\nIn this way I was able to produce all the pages I required as individual PDF files, - with all the unnecessary and bulky foreign language pages absent.\n\n\"Ampare PDF To Image\" was then used to convert all the individual PDF files to PNG images. Being PNG,they don't lose definition in the same way as JPG's and the files are small compared to BMP's.\n\nThe PNG images were then placed in the correct sequence in the Scribus Word Processor (from Ubuntu).\n\nIn this way I was able to create a cut-down file of each manual without the bulk of reams of unnecessary foreign language pages.\n\nScribus also has the facility to convert text and images to PDF, so I also converted the completed files back to PDF so that I could refer to these manuals via any computer system.\n\nAdditionally, I was able to reproduce my machine manuals at a size that could be easily read, and didn't need a magnifying glass to be able to see the words and diagrams!\n\nThis may seem to some a rather 'Long Winded' way of working, but It didn't take very long - and working on each page individually ensured that nothing was accidentally omitted and large blank spaces were avoided. I was very pleased with the quality of the finished results.\n\nMy thanks to the developer(s) for this application. I found it very useful, and will no doubt be using it again,\n\nOne niggly complaint about \"Ampare PDF To Image\" - I could find no way of reloading a second PDF into the program. I had to 'Close' the application and immediately reload it to perform the next operation.  However, the programme is so light that it loaded almost instantly - but a \"New\", or a \"Reload\" button would be an easy addition.\n\nI hope this review helps someone.\nThanks for reading this far.\nThisisI.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 224010, "score": 0, "summary": "Very useful application", "user_display": "ThisisI", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.amparepdftoimage-ovFUFDL24tKu7kgroIRQYuoQXFLk9q6O", "date_created": 1610096887.0, "description": "It functions but the default resolution is low and there's no option that I can find to increase it", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 325650, "score": 0, "summary": "Works but lacks options", "user_display": "Jeffrey", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.amparepdftoimage-ovFUFDL24tKu7kgroIRQYuoQXFLk9q6O", "date_created": 1628959444.0, "description": "great to convert PDF to PNG. the open/save dialog is out of place but the app works fine.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 409487, "score": 0, "summary": "great to convert PDF to PNG", "user_display": "pixel", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.amparepdftoimage-ovFUFDL24tKu7kgroIRQYuoQXFLk9q6O", "date_created": 1595232245.0, "description": "If you want to convert a pdf document, every page has to be treated separately.
