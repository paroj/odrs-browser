No hassles at all. It also has a dark mode but for some reason it didn't get activated automatically. I had to change it manually. \n4/5 only because the app doesn't use Kde plasma notifications API. it uses classic Qt dialogues instead. That is the only missing feature. I hope the dev implements that as well.
