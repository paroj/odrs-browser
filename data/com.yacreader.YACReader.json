Beside that, if I just launch the reader by a comic zip file, it will not auto go to the next zip (all zip files was in the same folder), that's is a big - , lot of comic was go by chapters, if zip was supported it should have option go to next zip automatically, the go to next and previous folder was also grayout, if I can only view files in 1 Zip at a time, I can just use the default zip manager. look forward for improvement, thanks.\n\nKDEneon Plasma ver. 5.27.4\nKernel Linux 5.19.0-40-gener\nQT ver. 5.15.9", "distro": "KDE neon", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 586875, "score": 0, "summary": "not work as comic reader", "user_display": "vk", "version": "9.12.0.2304234"}, {"app_id": "com.yacreader.YACReader", "date_created": 1707402210.0, "description": "doesnt support RAR5", "distro": "Arch Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 614084, "score": 0, "summary": "doesnt support RAR5", "user_display": null, "version": "9.13.1.2307166"}, {"app_id": "com.yacreader.YACReader", "date_created": 1709797540.0, "description": "Really nice minimal application but with enough features to easily read comics.
