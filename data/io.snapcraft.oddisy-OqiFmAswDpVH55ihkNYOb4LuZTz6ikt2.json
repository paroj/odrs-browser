There is no way to mass delete, so now I have to go through every single one of the 100 or so cards, deleting them one by one, and the program has this 'safety feature' that when you want to delete a card, it makes you type out the name of the card before you can delete it.\nSo if I make a location, with some individual abodes, people who live in them etc, and then eventually decide that I don't need any of that and I want to delete the place and everything in it... I'll have to go through those cards one by one, typing out their names to delete them as well.\nA mass delete option (or just an option when you're deleting one card to also delete all other cards linked to it) would be very appreciated.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 13, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 514490, "score": 57, "summary": "Very rudimentary", "user_display": "TrishaP", "version": "0.2.0"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.oddisy-OqiFmAswDpVH55ihkNYOb4LuZTz6ikt2", "date_created": 1673160341.0, "description": "It has nice UI, but it's too complicated process for accessing sample projects and deletion of unnecesary parts.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 553940, "score": 0, "summary": "Too complicated to use", "user_display": "Ragamorta", "version": "0.2.4"}]
