[{"app_id": "org.zrythm.Zrythm", "date_created": 1719042007.0, "description": "So, there are many reviews here that complain about various aspects of the software that do not belong to that software. \nFor example, there are people complaining about this flatpak only supporting flatpak plugins and no other plugins. Well, this is a flatpak app, so you can complain about flatpak, but not about Zrythm!\nI worked with it for some time and I can say that the user interface is really intuitive. It has (almost) no instruments pre-installed, but you can very easily get some if you extract sfz files from a sf2 file and then set the resulting directory as your sfz plugin directory. \nAlso, in my opinion the flatpak plugin system is big enough. We have the \"big\" plugins like the great ZynAddSubFX (with ZynFusion ui) and Surge here, what do we need more? Well, yes, there are many people that could port their plugins to flatpak, but that isn't the fault of Zrythm. \n\nSometimes Zrythm crashes, but remember: it's (as of now) pre-1.0 software! If we don't complain about those things but instead report the crashes (optimally even with debug info), then we can get those crashes away.", "distro": "Arch Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 625902, "score": 23, "summary": "Great pre-1.0 software (as of now)", "user_display": null, "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "org.zrythm.Zrythm", "date_created": 1646481976.0, "description": "Locks up system does nothing fix", "distro": "Manjaro Linux", "karma_down": 24, "karma_up": 17, "locale": "en_GB.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 1, "review_id": 467733, "score": 0, "summary": "bo good", "user_display": "Steff Skally", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "org.zrythm.Zrythm", "date_created": 1646773348.0, "description": "would be nice to try it...but cant", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 468558, "score": 0, "summary": "doesnt start after asking me to create a project", "user_display": "michael harper", "version": "1.0.0"}, {"app_id": "org.zrythm.Zrythm", "date_created": 1649867224.0, "description": "Poor attempt at audio software.

First I clicked on https://www.zrythm.org/en/download.html and was greeted with a subscription model which makes me very confused. Afterwards it seems like it\u2019s only for the installer, but I don\u2019t understand why I should use a installer if it\u2019s on flatpack.\n\nBut then I install it from flatpack and start it. It says it\u2019s very intuitive. I was able to create a new MIDI instrument, a bass, and then see the keyboard and grid where I can theoretically play it. But I can\u2019t find a way to select any instrument.\n\nAfter clicking around a bit I went on YouTube to find someone explaining how to do it and found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoP8on5ChUQ who explains that the free version doesn\u2019t let you save anything. It\u2019s a 3 years old video but I\u2019m thinking probably I should try if the flatpack version lets me save or not.\n\nSo I look around and see the hamburger menu top right where I hope a save option would be. I click the icon, the app freezes and then crashes.
