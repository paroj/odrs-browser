I mainly want to use it to write long compositions to play on my synthesizers, instead of being limited to step sequencers. It connects with no issues to my synths via midi. I also got Qsynth which enables me to have midi files play audio on my deck if I simply want to hear quick samples of my work before setting it all up with my synths for the grand performance.
