This scope does include mods as the typical server (exception : Mudwall) is continuously evolving with different mod combinations. The possible game styles available are seemingly limitless and the integration with normal game-play is nothing short of seamless. All this amazing madding potential under-shadows the level of depth, engagement, and subtle complexity that already holds the base game up as a fully satisfying standalone title.(returning example : Mudwall Server)\n\nThis doesn't go without a personal regret. The amount of time I'd spent this year - playing this game - pushed my almost gaming addiction into a real world problem. This problem was enough to force me to take a serious look at what (little) benefit most games gave - and whether the cost to my life was worth it. In the end almost all games were cut and the few that remained on the short list were because of community. VS, is the only game that offered something more than just a friend group however and now sits as the only game that is welcome on my daily ToDo.\n\nAs expected with communities and the ability to engage - there's a place for every kind of player out there. The excitement of combat and adventure, the satisfaction from meaningful progression, the engaging nature of role play, and the unrivalled creative potential that building mechanics have to offer in this game. These are but a few core gameplay avenues that players can have access too when playing. Different servers will have tailored experiences suited to serve on play style or another. My personal server is with a growing role-play community called MoonDrop. Come visit sometime.\n\nThis community in mind - the great reward that VS brings to the table is the strong creative collaboration between players, servers, modders, and *especially* the developers themselves. The potential for this game is through the roof and so is the ease of learning for any budding developers wanting to try their hand at it. So much is being unlocked on the back of this fantastic and robust engine that at times it's hard to even keep up. Best of all - this game is still thick with unrealised future features and - stable as it is - is still quite aways from finishing(if it ever will). On top of this - Tyron and his lovely crew are pushing out big updates that make the worlds most popular voxel game developers seem irredeemably incompetent.\n\nTo all those stubborn people saying \"Free or go home\" - just stop.
