However, for someone who isn't intimate with how the code is put together, it is virtually impossible to use. \n\nIt took me five tries to create a new file. The Create File dialogue has an active File Name field, but apparently you aren't supposed to use it for new files. Also, you need to know the file extension is \".doc\" once you do create and save your file, because the application won't add that information for you (nor does it specify -- I had to figure it out from the application's web site). Importing an image had tonnes of options... but didn't specify which image formats were supported. (I tried to import an SVG. Apparently that's not one of the supported formats.).\n\nIt's a desktop layout app, but there is no Text tool under the Tools menu. And so on.\n\nThat's not getting into things like drop-down menus painting off the edge of the monitor with no way to scroll through them. You need to make the overall app window smaller to see them all. Or have the exact same size monitor as the developer, I guess.\n\nWith a revamp to make this actually usable by other people, this looks like it might be a very useful app. I'd love to see a usable version.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 305369, "score": 0, "summary": "Nice feature set, shame about the usability", "user_display": "kmh", "version": "0.096.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.laidout-qPIkX4RBFSJgtZaHGyPMTkxxf7DVgHtT", "date_created": 1607973130.0, "description": "you should work to make SCRIBUS great again", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 316375, "score": 0, "summary": "work with scribus and this app", "user_display": "Andersen", "version": "0.096.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.laidout-qPIkX4RBFSJgtZaHGyPMTkxxf7DVgHtT", "date_created": 1632717054.0, "description": "I have been wanting a simple layout program for ages but couldn't get this one to work.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_AU.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 424001, "score": 0, "summary": "No go for me", "user_display": "Rod", "version": "0.096.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.laidout-qPIkX4RBFSJgtZaHGyPMTkxxf7DVgHtT", "date_created": 1619334525.0, "description": "Incompr\u00e9hensible, dimensions en pouces (vive le SI...), moche...", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_FR.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 369030, "score": 0, "summary": "Nul", "user_display": "Olivier", "version": "0.096.1"}, {"app_id": "io.snapcraft.laidout-qPIkX4RBFSJgtZaHGyPMTkxxf7DVgHtT", "date_created": 1634639711.0, "description": "\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430 -\u043c\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "ru_RU.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 430436, "score": 0, "summary": "\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e", "user_display": "yury", "version": "0.096.1"}]
