Overall I like it, it is similar to Cherrytree and Zim. More recently though I have had some issues with it installing on Ubuntu, I got it on one but not the other with the same OS version. When I was on Mac with it it would loose all it's formatting. I haven't seen that on Ubuntu yet though. With Cherrytree and Zim being free had I had that option when I bought this I would have gone with one of those, they are as good, maybe better and free. This is a good program though when it worls right.
