The review (https://www.linux.com/news/it-takes-patience-find-best-solitaire/) offers all the highs and lows of this program, as well as the other 2 most common.\n\nGood graphics; ability to change cards and background; hints; animation and auto-fill when it is appropriate are some of the things that makes this a great game.\n\nThe only thing that would make it better would be if when you click on the card the program automatically moves it to a logical location. (Note: there may be more than one logical location which would require the player to manually move a card).
