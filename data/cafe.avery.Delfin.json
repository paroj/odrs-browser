It's responsive, pretty, and feels right at home with other GTK/Libadwaita apps. Unfortunately, I have the same problem as another reviewer \"Luis\", that is- Movies and Shows are simple to access, but other \"Mixed\" content libraries don't show up at all, other than occasionally under the \"Continue watching\" section. I hope that, eventually, playing content from mixed-type libraries will become just as easy. Other than that, Delfin absolutely beats the stock Jellyfin client (which just feels like a thin wrapper around the webapp).
