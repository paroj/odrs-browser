It was simple and intuitive. A word of caution: when it did it's thing on the files, it did not create a new file with the reduced file size, it simply altered the file size of the original. So just be advised. So, as I was saying, it worked fine at first. Then yesterday I gave it a batch of about a dozen 16MB files to optimize and it appeared to be chugging away but nothing seems to have really been happening. After a long while (maybe an hour) I used Dolphin to examine the file sizes of the subject files, and nothing had been done. I tried over and over and got the same results. Right now I am about to try a fresh install and hopefully that will fix the problem.
