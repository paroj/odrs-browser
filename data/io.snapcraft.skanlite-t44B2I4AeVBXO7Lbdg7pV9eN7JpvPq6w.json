Ubuntu 22.04 automatically installed a driver that is working with its printing function, so that I can send documents to my printer through the USB port. Yet, it appears that it did not automatically install scanner support for my device. So, when I open this Scanlite application on my desktop, I get an error message saying: \"The SANE (Scanner Access Made Easy) could not find any device. Check that your scanner is plugged in and turned on or check your scanner setup.\" I tried to resolve this error message by looking up my scanner in the SANE project's website to find out what package I needed to install in my computer, in order to get it to work. By doing that, I discovered that sane-escl.5 works with my Canon PIXMA TR8520 scanner. (I found this information at http://sane-project.org/man/sane-escl.5.html.) Then, I tried to find out what I could install in order to get sane-escl.5 installed in my system. So, I found a page in the Ubuntu manual that told me that sane-escl.5 was included in libsane-common package.
