FSearch is the closest equivalent I was able to find - it launches fast, it gives me results instantaneously, and I love that. \n\nI have two suggestions for improvement, if the developer would consider them meaningful:\n1. When resizing the default fields in the program (e.g., \"Name\", \"Path\", \"Extension\"...), they should stay resized even after an app restart. Right now they go to their default size, which hides the long file and path names I have.\n\n2. Due to work, I am using OneDrive, which I have mounted automatically with Rclone Browser. I don't know if FSearch considers this an external drive (?), but I get no results from my mounted OneDrive (which is fully operational in my File Manager).\n\nOther than that, this is a fantastic app, so major props for making it available for us all.
