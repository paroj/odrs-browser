For one torrent it worked that way, for other not - it was being downloaded outside of alternative speed limit shedule. What's worse, even pausing this torrent didn't actually stop the downloading process. At least the progress bar indicated what was really going on, so I could close the app and not waste my GB limits.\n\nInputs are confusing. In the bottom left you have \"enable alternative speed limits\" button. What does it mean? To turn on settings of normal and alternative speed limits you have already made in Edit \u2192 Preferences window and thought they are applied? Or to override these settings and switch to alternative speed limits when normal are scheduled at the moment (and vice versa)? Turns out it's the latter. But now - the pressed turtle button indicates active alternative or normal operation? Or maybe the slower of them two, as the turtle icon suggests? Turns out it's the former, specifically pressed turtle button = active alternative speed limits. Doesn't matter if they are actually faster than normal, as was in my case.\n\nSo many implicit assumptions in GUI is a bad sign. Underlying code must be no different. No surprise torrents keep downloading after you paused them.
