Displays 3d models reliably. I like the layering slider on the side. However, options are very limitied, even non-existant. I would appriciate an option to change the color of the model. The icon to open a file is a download icon, which is confusing at first. It would be much better if it simply said 'open.' One last grudge I have (it maybe due to my system) is that I cannot set it to open as default when double clicking a file in file manager. Perhaps add an option in the app to make it defualt? However, over all, a very simple and usable viewer. 4 stars.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 383105, "score": 0, "summary": "Great app, could use some improvements", "user_display": "rolf", "version": "0.1.5"}]
