It doesn't advise when a screen scrape has been copied and if it does it either locks up or you have to open the app to see the screen copy. The biggest issue is it keep locking up and not responding using apps like Libreoffice, Chromium, System Monior etc,,, I'm using Ubuntu 23.04 on a 2021 Lenovo laptop... enough said cheers.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_AU", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 602817, "score": 0, "summary": "Slow n Locks Up", "user_display": "Vert", "version": "2.5.0-1"}]
