There are numerous features I like:\n\n1. It supports over 100 currencies. I do not use all of them, of course. However, it is great to know that I will be able to receive cryptocurrencies without making a brand new wallet.\n\n2. It has apps built-in. A few examples are the FTX app to buy crypto directly in your wallet and a staking app where the APY is surprisingly good.\n\n3. It is pleasing to look at. I absolutely love how they gave us spectacular designs.\n\n4. You can get information quickly through the charts.\n\n5.

Not only that but it also have a decent, albeit slightly more costly, exchange embedded.\n\nSo, for the above summarized reasons, Exodus is quite convenient. However, the GUI interface is really, really annoying. The fonts are quite small, with little contrast and overall quite difficult to read. The text cannot be copied unless there's an option for it by an icon. That means that if I want to quickly copy-paste a transaction into a spreadsheet the only option is to export into a csv file and then import it or copy-past from there. It's OKish, doable but not practical. Yet, as mentioned, the most annoying thing are the fonts used and their size, contrast and colors.\n\nOne last thing: it's NOT opensource. This does not just go against the spirit of cooperation and community but also against basic privacy and security principles. One has to trust the company 100%.
