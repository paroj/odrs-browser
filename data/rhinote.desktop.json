So, if you type up notes, and close the app, restart your computer, or do anything else at all ... and you don't physically, manually save your notes ... they will not be there when you open the app back up. To save your notes easily and quickly, press \"CTRL + S\" on your keyboard. \n\nRegarding changing the note's colors ... this is possible, but you have to edit the source code. See the website for the app for more info on how to do this and a few other \"hacks\". The website is https://rhinote.tuxfamily.org/screenshots.html\n\nOther than these things, I have downloaded and started to use this app and find it a great addition to my Linux desktop. Even better, it's written in Python which is a language I am beginning to study, so maybe I will be able to help contribute to the app some day.
