No clues given on what to do if you lose the rescue ship (escape past 5000 altitude). Volume controls would be appreciated, not just on and off. No explanation for rescue ships random accelerations, especially if they speed into an asteroid or force you off the refuel pad as you are refuelling and Boom). Would like to see warning on fuel gage, turning red and a warning sound maybe.\nSo far average, otherwise solid game.
