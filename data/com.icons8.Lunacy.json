I'm not sure if it's a Fedora issue, but I can only access the Documents, Downloads & Recents folders. I'm still having trouble with Lunacy remembering my Google login details, so I mainly use it offline.\n\nPlease fix some of these issues in the future. This app is incredible! I enjoy using it more than Figma. A feature request I'd make is improving control with the Pen tool. Currently, the Pen tool doesn't have as much flexibility with anchor points. You can't manipulate the direction points using shift or alt keys. It requires making edits after, and it's a bit limiting.", "distro": "Fedora Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 508877, "score": 0, "summary": "Almost perfect!", "user_display": "Ali Qureshi", "version": "8.6.2"}]
