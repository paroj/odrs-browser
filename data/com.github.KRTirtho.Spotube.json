A very lightweight and clear spotify alternative. It doesn't have any restrictions of a free account and integrates very well with an existing account! It does need you to sign in using a strange method where by you take some cookies using inspect element on your browser to sign in but after following the built in guide, it works perfectly. \n\nI mentioned in the summary that it needs a little polish. Here's what I have found.\n- Hovering over the buttons for each track in a playlist bring up a context text that reads \"widget\" no matter which of the four you hover over.\n- I can't really tell if a song I clicked download on has actually been downloaded. The button reacts to a click but there is no indication that the song is currently downloaded. (It does actually download if you check the destination directory)\n- There is no shuffle option\n- The download folder doesn't seem to be configurable\n- The playerlist download button is grayed out\n- the volume slider isn't consistant\n\nAll in all it's a cool product if you don't have a premium account. It's very lightweight too which is a big plus. It's just really needs some refinement.", "distro": "Nobara Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_CA.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 530506, "score": 23, "summary": "Works very well!
