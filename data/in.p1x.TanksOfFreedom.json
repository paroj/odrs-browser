[{"app_id": "in.p1x.TanksOfFreedom", "date_created": 1663880808.0, "description": "This game hearkens back to turn-based tactics games, with a number of notable changes that make it unique. Not all of these, sadly, are for the better. Tanks are somewhat overpowered by infantry spam, since three infantry can kill a tank and you can only counterattack once per turn, meaning that if multiple infantry get the first strike on a tank they're guaranteed to win the value trade. Speaking of value, your AP generation is the main resource you have to account for; you can produce as many units as you want from a barracks as long as you have the AP to move them a few spaces away, meaning with high income you can effectively bombard the map with troops. Since allied troops can't move through each other, your opponents will only ever be able to attack the outermost layer of your forces if they're clumped up, with no opportunity to drive a stake through the center. And captures are instant regardless of infantry health, so pretend everyone is victory-march-ing all the time. And fog doesn't prevent enemies from attacking after moving or cause traps when walking into an occupied space, so keep in mind, your opponents (and yourself) are both also sonja.\n\nAll in all a fantastic game, I'd love to play around with modding it a bit and try my hand at a good balance, but definitely an enjoyable time on its own.", "distro": "openSUSE Tumbleweed", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 521926, "score": 23, "summary": "If you like Advance Wars type games, you'll probably appreciate this", "user_display": "mari domo", "version": "0.7.0"}, {"app_id": "in.p1x.TanksOfFreedom", "date_created": 1665316553.0, "description": "This seems like a really cool game-- it works fine via html5 on the project's web site, but unfortunately the version uploaded here has a bug where clicking on 'deploy' does jack all :(", "distro": "Manjaro Linux", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 60, "reported": 0, "review_id": 527059, "score": 23, "summary": "If only deploy worked", "user_display": "Hailey M", "version": "0.7.0-beta (stable)"}, {"app_id": "in.p1x.TanksOfFreedom", "date_created": 1594729694.0, "description": "Extremely fun albeit short game", "distro": "Zorin OS", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 2, "locale": "en_GB", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 246933, "score": 0, "summary": "Great TBS game", "user_display": "RPGHank", "version": "0.7.0"}, {"app_id": "in.p1x.TanksOfFreedom", "date_created": 1598318204.0, "description": "The flatpak randomly quits mid campaign.", "distro": "Fedora", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 20, "reported": 0, "review_id": 262868, "score": 0, "summary": "Good Game // bad packaging", "user_display": "jake", "version": "0.7.0"}, {"app_id": "in.p1x.TanksOfFreedom", "date_created": 1610201189.0, "description": "One of the favorites games", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US.UTF-8", "rating": 100, "reported": 0, "review_id": 326102, "score": 0, "summary": "Must have", "user_display": "fenr1r", "version": "0.7.0"}, {"app_id": "in.p1x.TanksOfFreedom", "date_created": 1666386313.0, "description": "The game might be interesting.
