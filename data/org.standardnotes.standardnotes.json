They are full of oddities (default line spacing / no possibility to set up a default, only one level of bullet point, copy pasting from another app seems to break formatting, slight lag when you type, ... the list goes on)\n- the check list editor is fairly basic, you can't move tasks up and down, you can't use a simple cut and paste either, ...\n\nI want to love this app, but every time I check it, I get frustrated with it after a few minutes.\nI wish there was an Apple Note like app within the open source ecosystem, I'd be willing to pay for it if the price is right.
