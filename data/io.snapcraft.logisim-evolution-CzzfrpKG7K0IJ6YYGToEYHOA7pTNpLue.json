From a command line, type \"logisim-evolution\" (without the quotes, duh).\n\nI have gone through the tutorial which provides a nice intro. There are some edits that need to happen here, but nothing too bad. On version 3.8, the part where it tells you to select the \"input tool\" and \"output tool\", the help text on the icon itself reads \"add pin\". They are the two icons just to the left of the gates in the tool bar.\n\nAnyway - looking through all the other supplied gates and components shows a nice selection of things to tinker with. You can build all the functionality of the 7400 series, and this would be a great learning exercise. The inclusion of complex components makes this a really nice program.\n\nI installed the snap, but will probably download the source from github and build it myself. But the snap does make it easy to be up and running in no time.\n\nCurrently I am exploring this thing further to see what I can build with it.
