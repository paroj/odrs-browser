My files are compatible with pretty much all the latex editors. But with Setzer I cannot see my figures on the generated pdf file. I can only see empty squares. Any idea?\nAlso suggestion for future updates : create an option for a live auto-generated pdf file, \"\u00e0 la\" Gummie. This is 2019 and I reckon this should be the way to go. In any case Setzer is likely to become the best piece of sotware in the yard. Keep up the good work !

So they all came up with errors (unable to load in eps graphics) or psfrag simply not working. It is quite a shame since it is near perfect in other ways.
