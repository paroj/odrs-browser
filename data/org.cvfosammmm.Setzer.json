The tool has potential and integrates very well with Gnome, but the compilation is the worst ever seen : 1. Poor options, you cannot select many compilers 2. you cannot compile only the bibliography 3. most of the time doesn\u00b4t read your bibliography correctly read and compiled by other tools, and doesn\u00b4t export the tex in docx as other tool do nowadays. I thought was a promising tool but is not ready for the real world. Furthemore the Flatpack has only one compiler working and most of the time crashes, the rpm version of the fedora repository works better, but with no dynamic theming and furthermore requires to install all the latex library to be ready to use, but there is no warning about it.
