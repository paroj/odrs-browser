[{"app_id": "xmahjongg.desktop", "date_created": 1627233276.0, "description": "The GOOD: Has 144 tiles (the correct number for Mahjongg layouts) \u2013 this (to me) is of primary importance. There is only one layout, but it is the primary traditional layout (which is good). It has reasonably sized tiles (a good thing because enlarging the window does not expand the size of the tiles), and it plays well - with the traditional Mahjongg Solitare rules. \n\nThe primary problem for me is that it doesn't have option to show ONLY winnable layouts and you can't tell if layouts are winnable or not. It has no option to replay same game; I don\u2019t want to start a game unless I know it is winnable - even if it is difficult to do win, it is POSSIBLE, and I'm not just spinning my wheels. That isn\u2019t fun to me.\n\nSecondary problems (bells & whistles) that don\u2019t make it unplayable for me, but would be nice to have: (1) it doesn't tell you when no more moves are left (2) it doesn't show the removed tiles (3) it doesn\u2019t say how many matches are available (unless you like to count dots) (4) it only has one tileface and it cannot be changed, which would be okay since it\u2019s (basically) the traditional set - except drawn such a way that a few of the tiles are a bit hard to tell apart. You\u2019d probably get used to them.", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "en_US", "rating": 40, "reported": 0, "review_id": 402678, "score": 0, "summary": "Winnable?", "user_display": "AnneF", "version": "3.7-5"}, {"app_id": "xmahjongg.desktop", "date_created": 1637159172.0, "description": "tr\u00e8s bon jeux je recommande", "distro": "Ubuntu", "karma_down": 0, "karma_up": 0, "locale": "fr_FR.UTF-8", "rating": 80, "reported": 0, "review_id": 439172, "score": 0, "summary": "tres bon", "user_display": "abardin", "version": "3.7"}]
