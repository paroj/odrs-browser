Not only can I now play this on my favorite OS, its better in ever way! Crisp graphics, full widescreen, ability to see effect overlays when placing buildings automatically, smooth mouse scrolling. I love what you've done with this. Simply mount your windows drive with the game installed and copy the installation folder to wherever you like, then point to it when loading the game for the first time and it just makes everything work, and improves it! Even the save games come over.
