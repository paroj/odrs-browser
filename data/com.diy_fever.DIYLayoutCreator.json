One has fancy graphics and other unnecessary features which make it slow and awkward to use, another has an approach would only appeal to users with a very specific requirement.\n\nThis is the third. It is a very professional and effective program which is undergoing regular development. It does exactly what is needed, has an intuitive user interface, good graphics but not so fancy that they get in the way and useful functions but not obscure ones. For integration with schematic design software it can import a netlist. The menus are available in eight languages.
