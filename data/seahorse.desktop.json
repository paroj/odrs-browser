If there's a security flaw or some advanced gripe, theoretically someone should leave a review. I am, on my end, very enthralled to have this kick-arse, free piece of arcane machinery code! It is indeed pretty darn cool. I just got through making my own key for the very first time. So, I don't know much about it, yet, but I'm giving it five stars. It is exciting to use this baby. I flat out love it so far. I have not tried yet to do anything advanced with it, as I just commenced studying it on something semi-whimsical within the preceding few hours, during which time I was admittedly mostly doing other tasks. Anyway, it's pretty cool, just look for a guide on how to use it. I am truly excited about it. Linux is awesome. This program is pretty friggin' cool, and it is free. \n\nAnyway, I do indeed thusly begin to digress to a greater extent than I probably can do without being passe.
