[{"app_id": "io.snapcraft.subtitlecomposer-GKA9u31sBP79Nhy8p8CQVYVnDFSaYQgg", "date_created": 1650457007.0, "description": "I'm using Ubuntu 18.04\n\nI've been looking for a simple Speech to Text application. I'd also like to add subtitles to some video's I have produced without having to listen and then write down what is being said (which I can do already). \n\nThis application seemed to fit my requirements. I installed it and looking at the menu - the options seemed intuitive, so I loaded a video of an interview.\n\nTo start with there was a very bad sound echo - probably lag from sound directly from my PC overlaying sound relayed by the application. I could NOT find anything that even reduced the echo - even playing the the PC sound settings. \n\nSince the Waveform of the sound track seemed unaffected, I simply turn the PC sound off! Not really a problem for me\n\nNext was to attempt to get text to appear in response to the spoken sound track. Nothing obvious was found.\n\nThe 'Help' menu shows a link to the \"Subtitle Composer Handbook\". Clicking the link takes me to the KDE page and a statement to the effect that \"The Handbook does not exist, did I spell it correctly?\" It is a LINK!\n\nFurther investigation tells me that there is a \"Chatroom\" for users of this application. However, like the Handbook, a 'Chatroom' does not exist (although I was invited to \"Sign Up and Create a Chatroom\". Hardly useful!!\n\nEven deeper investigation determines that the Plug-In \"PocketSphinx\" is required to make the Speech to Text application work.\n\nI track down \"PocketSphinx\" and find all sorts of information - but none that is useful to \"ME\"! I don't have the knowledge, the time or the inclination to include PocketSphinx in the Source Code of this application.\n\nI use applications on Ubuntu to create 'things' - whether it is text, a drawing or I simply 'watch' a video. I don't find it enjoyable wasting my time tinkering and fiddling with applications in the hope that I can get them to work.\n\n Lots of Ubuntu software \"works straight out of the box\"  without ANY requirement to delve into the engine compartment.\n\nIf you (The Developer) create an application for me, I want to simply install it and USE it!  Just because YOU, the developer understands all the intricacies of Linux, don't assume that EVERYBODY ELSE understands them as well. It is this sort of attitude that sustains the \"Linux is really only for the Technically Knowledgeable users\" that we all so frequently see. \n\nALL software should work \"straight out of the box\" without the necessity to wander around the internet searching for additional vital components to make the application work.\n\nAlso, if you provide a link to a Handbook, make sure the damned pages exist first - AND that the link works as it should. \n\nNow, if I've missed something blatantly obvious - like a button to press, I will be the first to withdraw my comments and apologise. I will check back here and see.\n\nOkay! Rant over.
