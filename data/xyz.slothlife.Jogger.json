Unfortunately it doesn't respect any theming in phosh, neither libadwaita or legacy/GTK3 dark. Can't use on my PPP: Can't stop a timer after you start it, and the timer doesn't increment. Needs to check if the user even has their modem turned on, and handle accordingly, if the app is trying to use GPS.
