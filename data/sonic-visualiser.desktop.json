No MP3/WAV file cloning when analyzing audio files.\n2) Layers are great - text, segments etc..\n3) Easy way to mark region and loop them\n4) Changing tempo (without affecting pitch) is just mouse-wheel scroll away..\n\nMany other cool stuff.

I don't get why there isn't just a pass-through mode, where audio playing on one app also stimulates the visualizations in this app. Loading individual mp3 files is rather tedious.
